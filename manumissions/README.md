# Manumissions - Quakers & Slavery

## What am I looking at?
In this folder are datasets from the collection of manumissions from the Friends Historical Library at Swarthmore College. Each dataset is an index of manumissions, in which the most important information in each manumission is placed in a searchable spreadsheet. The purpose of these datasets are to open another avenue for Black Genealogy. This project is a continuation of the work done at Haverford College in the project [*Manumitted, The People Enslaved by Quakers*](https://manumissions.haverford.edu/).

## What is a manumission?
A manumission is a formal document that promises to free an enslaved person. Most manumissions follow a similar formula:
- Name of enslaver(s)
- Place of residence of enslaver(s)
- Acknowledgment of the immoraity of slavery according to Quaker values
- Names, ages, and assumed gender of the enslaved
- When the enslaved will be free
- Date of signature
- Signatures of witness(es)
- Signature of enslaver(s)

No two manumission are exactly alike, but most follow some order of these guidelines. In many cases, some manumissions will be missing information (most often about the enslaved people). Additionally, enslavers will often keep ownership over minors until they reach the age of 21 for men or 18 for women. It is important to note that while a manumission is a promise of freedom, it is entirely possible that said freedom was not fully given immediately.

## History of Quakers & Slavery
Quakers have a complicated history with slavery. They are known as abolitionists, advocating for the freedom of Black people across the Americas. It is imperative, however, to dive deeper into this history and gain a thorough understaning of Quakers' role in slavery during the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries. While Quakers were widely abolitionists, it is also true that many were indifferent to slavery, participated in the slave trade, and/or were enslavers themselves. Over the course of two centuries, more and more Quakers became advocates for abolition leading up to the 13th Amendment ratified in 1865.

### Timeline of Quakers & Abolition
- In 1676, Irish Friend William Edmunson is the first Quaker to write that slavery is unchrisitian. Edmunson highlighted the conflict enslavemnt created bewteen two important Quaker beliefs: the sancity of property rights and the belief that each person should be free to explore their own relation with God. 
- In 1688, the Germantown Friends in Philadelphia were the first to bring the issue of slavery to a body of friends in the Germantown Protest Against Slavery.
- In the 1700s, the main persepectives on slavery held that the majority of Quakers had no qualms with enslavement and did not find it inconsistent with Quaker beliefs. Others believed that enslaved people should be treated kindly but did not go as far as emancipation. Few, like Edmunson, Warner Mifflin, Elias Hicks, Abigail Goodwin, Lucretia Mott, and others were full abolitionists who moved other Quakers to manumitt their enslaved people.
- In the 1700s and continuing into the 19th century, the London Yearly Meeting warns Friends in the United States to stop participation in the slave trade.
- In 1717, John Farmer writes *Epistle Concerning Negros* and presents it at Rhode Island Yearly Meeting and is disowned.
- In 1737, Benjamin Lay publishes *All Slave-Keepers, That Keep the Innocent in Bondange, Apostates and is disowened from Philadelphia Yearly Meeting.
- Throughout the 1750s and 1760s, John Woolman becomes an abolitionist and publishes *Some Considersations on The Keeping of Negros*.
- In 1774 and 1778, many Yearly Meetings restrict the buying and selling of slaves but do not completely abolish ownership of slaves.
- Throughout the last two decades in the 18th century, more restrictions on slave trade are put in place and many Quakers begin to petition Congress to abolish slavery.
- In 1833, slavery is abolished in the British Empire, and in 1865, slavery is abolished in the United States after the Civil War.

## Notes
Creation of the indicies and datasets was done at the Friends Historical Library at Swarthmore College by Whitney Grinnage-Cassidy '24 and Zahara Martinez '23 as apart of the Black Genealogy Fellowship in summer 2022.
