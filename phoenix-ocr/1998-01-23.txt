Students Commemorate 25 Years of Roe v. Wade
Both Pro-Life and Pro-Choice Students Mark Anniversary
of a Divisive Landmark Case
by Emily Shartin
Twenty-five years ago, on January 22, 1973, the Supreme Court
legalized abortion in America with
its ruling in the case ofRoe v. Wade.
Since then, the nation has seen the
>ntinuance of an intense debate
over the freedoms granted to
women by the Roe decision. This
week, both Swarthmore Students
Advocating Life (SSAL) and the
Pro-Choice Task Force (PCTF)
marked the 25th anniversary ofRoe
v. Wade with observances and reflections of their own.
On Thursday, members of SSAL
took part in a national pro-life
march that has been held annually
in Washington D.C. on January 22
for the past 25 years. Sabrina Boyer
01, a member of SSAL who has
participated in the march for the last
two years, calls it "a very unifying
experience. It's inspirational to see
• lotof positive, enthusiastic people
supporting something they care
about." But at the same time, SSAL
co-coordinator JulieSchwendiman
'99 adds, "We want people to understand that not everyone sees

[this anniversary] as a celebration...
it's also a time to reflect upon what
our governmen' is doing and perhaps to make some reconsiderations."
PCTF is staging various events on
campus including yesterday's tabling, movie screenings tonight and
tomorrow, and a party Saturday
night in Paces. PCTF co-coordinator Rich Vezina '99 is "excited
about the anniversary," but notes
that "it is a reminder of all the
struggles leading up to Roe v.
Wade," as well as "all the struggles
we've had to undergo since then to
maintain it. And the struggle isn't
over... we have to continue to be
vocal and active so that a woman's
right to choose isn't eliminated."
While Boyer and Schwendiman
agree that SSAL is "not out to
change everyone's mind," as many
pro-life groups are, they do hope
to encourage people to think twice
about their actions. "I was prochoice in the beginning," says
Boyer. "But then I read the gruesome details of what actually happens [during an abortion]. I think
if more people knew [those details]
they would be pro-life." Although

Schwendiman believes that "taking
away life" and whether or not "a
mother can make thatdecision" are
at the heart of the issue, she also
says, "The one thing we feel would
be a success for our cause would
be giving women support, whether
it be post-abortion counseling or
alternative pregnancy resources."
Vezina mentions that the goals of
PCTF are also not necessarily to
convert people, but he also concedes, "It's easy to be inactive on
such a pro-choice campus." Likewise, Aarti Iyer '99, also a PCTF
coordinator, says, "The fact that the
pro-choice side won [in 1973] has
made everyone kind of complacent.
This is not a freedom we should
take lightly." Both stress the importance of increasing reproductive
and contraceptive awareness on
campus.
Michele Rivkin-Fish, a Visiting
Assistant Professor of Sociology
who will be teaching a class this
semester entitled "Culture and Politics of Reproduction," is alarmed by
the increased polarization of the
two sides of the abortion debate in
America. As a result, she worries
that in the future there will be fewer

attempts at conversation. "After the

College and Borough Come Together
to Renovate the Business District
by Kathryn Tong
In a presentation on January Bth,
Christopher Leinberger, a former member of the Swarthmore College Board
of Managers, asked the Swarthmore
community to consider a renovation of
the town's business district. Held before a reported crowd of 175, the presentation has been a wake up call for
both members of the College administration and Borough residents.
Leinberger, an alumnus of Swarthmore and current real estate analyst,
believes that the Swarthmore area is in
the midst of an economic decline, and
if no action is taken, that places such
as the Springfield Mall will continue
to draw business away from the Borthe
ough.
During
presentation.Leinberger discussed two
options that Swarthmore has for improvement: renovating what business
district town already has or investing
in retail businesses such as restaurants
and specialty stores.
Although there are some who do not
agree with Leinberger's ideas, both
College and Borough officials have
come to the general consensus that a
change must be made. Bill House, the
President of the Borough government's
Business District Authority, is aware
both of a history of disagreements between the College and Borough as well
as a need to cooperate. According to
House, the College has had a reputa-

P. Runkle

tion in the past as being "an unfriendly
neighbor." Some residents are suspicious that the College has its own selfserving agenda. Others are worried
about the loss of existing businesses in
the district as well as the family- ori-

ented character of the Borough.
Yet both the College and the Borough
have decided that it is in their best interests to come together and formulate
a plan for renovation. House is optimisA

listen to them... it's the only way
for dialogue to happen."
While there are of course fundamental differences in the goals and
ideals of SSAL and PCTF, both do
agree that support for women is
critical. Along these lines, the idea
of a reproductive options
roundtable involving both members
of PCTF and SSAL has been suggested and will likely be pursued

as a joint venture later in the semester. "TheRoe v. Wade decision puts
tremendous pressure on a woman
to make a choice that she might not
make," says
to

Schwendiman, "We want to ensure
a non-hostile environmentfor pregnant women." Iyer adds, "There's
a lot that both sides could be working on to prevent unwanted pregnancies in the first place."

Dean and Vice President Positions
to be Filled by Summer
by Nate Stulman
The College is currently engaged in searches
to fill the positions of Dean of the College and
theVice Presidentfor Alumni, Development, and
Public Relations. Administrators say they hope
both vacancies will be filled by this summer.
While the search for the vice president will be
managed by an outside executive firm, the search
for a new dean is being conducted internally by
a committee of administrators, faculty, and students.
The Dean's Search Committee, chaired by
Biology Professor Mark Jacobs, received well
over 100 applications, approximately eight of
which remain under consideration as semi-finalists. Student committee member Josh Alloy
'9B says the search committee will be aided by
a task force of eight students in conducting phone
interviews that will determine a short list of finalists who will visit the campus in March.
"The object [of the planned visits]," added
Professor Jacobs, "will be to get the most people
and constituencies in touch with the candidates
and able to interact with them
as we can.
A final decision should be announced in April."
According to committee members, applicants
have included deans, senior administrators, and
professors as well as corporate CEOs and military officials. Applicants with experience at Ivy
League schools including Harvard, Yale,
Princeton and Brown were among those considered, as well as candidates from schools such
as Stanford and Oberlin. Members of the search
committee also confirmedthat Acting Dean Bob
Gross is among the eight semi-finalists and was
the only applicant from within the Swarthmore
community.
According to committee member Hugh We-

ber 'OO, the College actively sought applicants
from diverse backgrounds. "Issues of gender,
race, and sexual orientation are very much a part
of our consideration," said Weber. The College
advertised the position in a variety of education
publications, including The Chronicle ofHigher
Education, Hispanic Outlook, Black Issues In
Higher Education, andAmerAsia Journal. Jacobs
estimates that perhaps one-third of the applicants
were persons of color and 40 percent were
women.
"Obviously we're looking for the best overall
candidate," remarked Alloy. "A comprehensive
personal statement explaining why a candidate
was seeking the position and their vision for the
future was very important to us." When asked
about diversity as a factor in the decision, Alloy
noted, "We definitely have it in the back of our
minds. We'd love to have a Dean who is a woman
and/or a person of color."
After reviewing several executive search firms,
the College has also decided upon the Bostonbased firm of Isacson, Miller to manage its search
for a new vice president. Representatives from
Isacson, Miller visited campus this week to meet
with senior staff and members of the Board of
Managers in order to gain an appreciation for
what the College is looking for in a new vice
president. Previously held by Harry Gotwals
until his sudden death in October, responsibilities associated with this particular vice presidency include orchestrating the College's
fundraising efforts, maintaining and strengthening alumni relations, and overseeing public relations.
President Al Bloom and Associate Vice President Maurice Eldridge are working with the
search firm and anticipate compiling a slate of
three to five finalists for the position within 10

The NCAA has announced several new restrictions on college wrestling programs, including a seven-pound increase in the maximum

Swarthmore benefactor Eugene
Lang '3B has recently come under
media scrutiny for an act of philanthropy he began in June of 1981.
On that day, Lang shocked a
crowd ol sixth graders and their
parents saying that he would provide scholarships to all who succeeded in completing high school
and gaining acceptance to college.
Lang had been asked to give a
speech to the graduating class ofhis
alma mater, P.S. 121 in East
Harlem. Yet the words he had initially planned for this class never
reached them. Instead, inspired to
give a chance to a group of kids
who were headed to high schools
with 75% plus drop-out rates, Lang
put his speech aside. Off the cuff,

he offered these youngsters of
eleven, twelve and thirteen an opportunity that had not existed a few
minutes earlier.
Indeed the numbers tell an aweinspiring story; nearly 90 percent
of the 61 students graduated from
high school, and over half enrolled
in college. Truly, Lang's scholarship offer provided the impetus for
many students to persevere against
all odds in order to achieve their
goals.
What the numbers don't elucidate
is the ambiguity that has lingered
over Lang's gift from the beginning. In a recent Dateline segment
airing on NBC late in December,
Ann Curry probed the situation to
unearth the human elements behind
this seemingly straightforward gift
of hope. Many of thekids of Lang's
chosen class apparently felt that

they were misled. Considerable
controversy exists as to the exact
amount that was offered by Lang.
He insisted to Curry that it was
spelled out that after high school
each student would receive only
$5OO per year for four years toward
college.
However, it wasn't that simple for
many of the students who looked
forward to college with great expectations, understanding that Lang
would pay their full tuition. One
student interviewed in the segment
arrived at college only to find that
the money he was receiving would
only cover books and not his
schooling. He was left with no recourse but to return home. Out of
the 29 students that began college,
reportedly only nine have finished,
and many cited economic hardship
as the reason they left. They pointed

to false hopes kindled by Lang.
It seems that from the start there

was simply an enormous misunderstanding as to what exactly Lang
promised, a misunderstanding persee page 4

Rising From the Ashes...
At its peak in the 19705, The Phoenix came out three times a
week and had a staff of close to 100 people. Last semester, the
size ofthe entire staff was less than half ofthat. The Yale Daily has
a larger freshman writing staff.
So, what happened in between? Obviously there has been a serious decline in student interest. It would be pointless to point fingers right now, but the bottom line is, something went wrong somewhere. But the bad part about the downfall of a publication is that
it creates a vicious cycle
less people get involved, the quality
goes down, and then even less people get involved.
Rising from the ashes is not an easy task. It will entail first an
accurate analysis of the problems plaguing the paper and a corresponding solution, and second, a concerted and well-supported
effort to implement the solution.
The most major problem hindering The Phoenix, as we see it, is
its lack of consistency. The system of semester-long editorships
has contributed to the decline significantly. When an earlier "administration" leaves, the newcomers are left to start from scratch.
There is no transition. And by the time the new kids on the block
figure out all the mechanics of producing the paper, half a semester is gone.
No, the problem is not the writing. Who said Swatties can't write?
The problem is building a system by which we can consistently
recruit writers and train them to write well.
The solution is to build a solid infrastructure within The Phoenix organization so that whatever changes that are brought in will
be permanent. Superficial changes
such as revamping the laycan come and go.
out and improving the outlook of the paper
The infrastructure can involve many components, but all in all it
would be an attempt to standardize procedures and processes. The
key to permanence is method. For example, we are in the process
of developing writing manuals and workshops for writers. On the
editorial level, a set of guidelines will be drafted to refine and
prioritize story ideas. Getting the nice pictures and good submisfiguring out how to get them consissions is only a beginning
tently and systematically is the challenge.
But all this is easier said than done. Change is difficult when
you are used to doing the things they used to be done.Yet commitit's getting the change done
ting to change is the easy part
that's the hardest. Because we are starting from scratch, each one
of the staff members will have to make tremendous sacrifices to
get the paper on the right track. Both our personal and academic
lives will take a heavy toll. Many ofyou have perhaps heard about
the infamous Thursday all-nighter on Parrish sth. But there is much
more, much more to it than that.
In other words, we can't do it alone.
But if each one of you makes a small sacrifice, the accumulative
effect would be enormous. As mentioned earlier, the potential it
out there
there is an abundance of Swatties who excel in writit's just a matter of
ing, drawing, laying out and taking pictures
tapping it. With the manpower and the right ideas, moving forward at the right pace, there is absolutely no reason why we can't
produce a top-notch journalistic publication, at least one which is
comparable to our academic reputation.
And what can you do and how would it make a difference?
Well, by simply particpating in the paper you are already making a difference. Consistent participation definitely help oil the
cogwheels. But the key is that your presence alone will reinforce
the momentum.
The Phoenix is a community newspaper. None of its editorial
staff are paid. The mission of the paper is to provide the community with a journalistically sound and lively source of information. So by partaking is this crucial period ofreform you would be
doing a tremendous service to the entire campus community.
We have come to a crucial juncture in Phoenix history where a

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
College must do more to combat hate speech on campus
To the hditor:
During this past semester, particular members
of the queer community have become the victims of several attacks that were executed by
prejudiced Swarthmore students. These attacks were so blatant and malicious that
students called upon the deans to address
the problems. The result of their meeting was a mere email stating an intent to act by creating new institutional policies, when in fact the existing policies address such issues. As it stands now, over a
month has passed without the
College having publicly acknowledged these events
and implementing a definitive action plan. If
the personal safety of
these students is under question, then j
the College needs
to administer a
specific action
plan to put an
end to the oppression and torment imposed by
discriminatory students.
Since these occurrences were almost at the end
of the semester, there was little or no attention
devoted to confront them. Slanderousstatements

were clearly written on a bathroom wall in a
residence hall, a group of students was hunting for a queer student on campus, and the College did not admit to the severity of these acts.
It is clear that the well-being of queer students
on this campus is in jeopardy given
these acts ofintolerance and hatred.
According to the Swarthmore
College Bulletin of this academic year, one viewpoint
maybe that Swarthmore students have the right offree
speech. The policy allows students to "acknowledge their right
to express differing
opinions...and free
expression on and
off campus." Therefore, any student
who wishes to air
his/her opinion in
either written or
oral form has the
right to do so. However, with any right, there is always some restraint as to how far it can be used.
Although a student can exercise his/her right
to "free expression," it becomes harassment
and intimidation when it undermines the al>

*

ready frazzled sense of community on
this campus. Once the acts become "repeated and persistent," with the destructive purpose of "...interfering with peaceful enjoyment of residence and community," then that imparts a sense of inferiority and shame upon the targeted group.
To this end, the queer community suffers from the oppression of a minority
of students, and the College perpetuates
this tyranny through lack of acknowledgment and action.
Before writing this article, I too was
an oppressor because I knew of these detestable events without expressing my
disapproval publicly. With this article, I
hope to make other students aware that
the so-called liberty on this campus is at
stake if narrow-minded students perform
acts of clear animosity against a target
group, which in this case is the queer
community. It is the obligation of the
College to preserve thisfreedom with definitive action plans, which are within a
reasonable timeperiod, to deter students
from this deplorable type of behavior. If
this continues, then the oppression will
remain, and students will continue to live
in fear.

'

Dancing On Asia's 'Grave'

Like

hounds snarling at the flanks of
a wounded deer, critics of East and
Southeast Asia's myriad of political systems have started writing scathing
editorial pieces rejoicing at the region's
seeming collapse. Recent op-ed pieces that
fit into this category include those of Hong
Kong's Martin Lee and America's William
Safire. In the minds of both men, Asia's
economic problems arise from the region's
alleged unwillingness to grant political
freedoms to her citizens. Taking careful
swipes at Singapore's Lee Kwan Yew for
example, Safire condemns what he terms
the subtle dictatorships that populate
Southeast Asia. He and
Mr. Lee conclude by
arguing that in order to
return lustre to Asia's
economies, political reform must take place.
Examined on its own,
it is difficult to fault either Safire or Lee.
Placed within a historical context, the weaknesses in their argu-

Safire once again discount the internal
choices these countries made. Neither author finds it useful to note that Malaysia,
following its 1969 race riots, adopted its
current political system to avoid turmoil;
or Indonesia's decision to develop the functional group system of politics to prevent
the bloodshed tension between communists
and muslims in 1964-65; or Singapore's
economic survival battles followings its
expulsion from the Malaysian Federation;
or South Korea's tortured attempts to come
to terms with being a weak state, surrounded by historically predatory states.
These internal issues, among others, drove
these states to develop into what
they are. Thus pundits are flawed in
their
approach
when they attempts
to draw a link between the durability
of a system of political thought and a
society's economic
architecture. That
East Asia's economies are suffering a
bout of the flu does
not mean that each societys organizing
principles should be ditched.
Do we have a right to unjustly criticize
them? No, I don't believe so. Imagine if
when the S & L crisis had taken place, or
when America was undergoing its economic problems in the 1980s, Asian commentators pointed to the civil rights movement or affirmative action policies as the
reason why America was coming apart at
the seams? No, I am not advocating the
nonsense called cultural relativism. The
issue here is about having respect for the
choices people make. My anger at commentators is this: if you are going to criticize, you had better become familiar with
the history of the region, and not just let
words spew forth from your mouth. The
puhditTreacfion is once again indicative
of a deep misunderstanding of Asia; if it is
distant and powerful, glamorize it and write
papers on how dangerous a region it is. If
it is down and in pain, dance on its grave
and proclaim the victory of liberalism.
Pooh, what nonsense!
Asia's problems come from the institutional weaknesses of its capitalism. That
is a perfectly acceptably situation given the
relative youth of the region's economies
compared to Europe's or North America's.
Asia's leaders are committed to tackling
these weaknesses, and the evidence from
the region is positive as to their willingness to reform theireconomies. It is in bad
taste to kick a seemingly dying man, and
attempt to humiliate him. For those who
are willing to keep the faith, Asia's economic miracle will not disappear; it will
return strengthened and will continue to
insist on finding a balance between individual freedom and society's stability.

So what'sit gonna cost? Lang's little Institute will probably have an annual operating budget of a million dollars to maintain a building, conduct programs and research, and pay the salaries of community
organizers and other staff. More than anything else, you need good community organizers. An effective community organizer bridges the gap between academic
consultation and communitypractice. They
are connected to the community in ways
that simply are not possible for time-constrained students and faculty. Organizers
serve as a vehicle for introducing the enlightened ideas of the academy to the common folk. Of course this is all just pure
fantasy. There are plenty ofless risky ways

the Administration demonstrated more
leadership in its involvement with Chester.
I really think the College could find more
effective ways to use its resources which
would address the underlying social, economic, and political forces that plague the
poorest city in Pennsylvania. Aggressive
political action informed by academic research would be more appropriate. Swarthmore needs the commitment, creativity,
and vision necessary for integrating community involvement in its curriculum.
We're lucky to have illustrious alumni
like Eugene Lang who generously support
the College. Given Mr. Lang's strong interest in providing opportunities for urban
youth, he might be interested in funding a
five year demonstration project in Chester
let's call it the Swarthmore Institute.
Our basic assumption is that the institutions in Chester are incapable of reform
without the intervention of the proverbial
"white knight." Enter Lang, Bloom, et al.
We also assume that there are plenty of
people and organizations doing wonderful things, but there is no major player with
the capacity and incentive to address the
core institutional failures. You could bring
the entire faculty down to Chester and it

wouldn't make any difference if the residents, bureaucrats, and politicians don't
have the resources or commitment for instituting reforms. Our Institute's mission
is uncompromising
to serve as an advocate for public housing, education, and employment in that order. Knowing the issues of public housing residents gives you
a baseline for the poorest population in the
city. Moreoverthere are major political and
economic incentives for addressing public
housing and education because you are
dealing with institutions that impact a large
segment of the population and directly influences their social and economic prospects. Politically speaking, everybody can
unite behind education, housing, and employment. Furthermore, the housing author-,
ity and the school district have their own
budgets. It's just a matterpf political strategy to get them to spend it on the right
things. Even an inexperienced nobody like

ments start emerging.
For starters, both men
argue that the system
of thought termed Asian values, which
seeks to balance the interests of the individual and society, is merely tyranny by
another name. After presenting arr oversimplified analysis, they discount the
choice made by other cultures to defend
their communities against crime and inter
sub-national group conflict. In so doing,
they lump together in the same analytical
breath, Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia and
South Korea
societies radically different from each other in their set of conundrums and solutions chosen to tackle them.
Also, both authors conveniently forget that
at least in Malaysia and Singapore, the ruling governments were democratically
elected by citizens fully aware of what they
where doing and the implications of such
choices.
Second, both authors engage in a triumphant end-of-history dance, pointing fingers and saying, I told you so. Their intention? To demonstrate that History, the grim
reaper, will not absolve non-western societies whochoose to strike out on their own.
Like Francis Fukuyama and other liberal
intellectuals did at the close of the Cold
War, they both proclaim the victory of a

PGA Ought to Let Disabled Golfer Ride On
by Benjamin Chan
Casey Martin, 25, is an aspiring profes
sional golfer afflicted with KlippelTrenaunay-Weber syndrome, a congenital defect which severely limits his ability to walk. The rules of the Professional
Golf Association (PGA) stipulate that
no golfer under the age of 50
shall be allowed to use a
golf cart in any of the
professional
events it over-

against the PGA, Martin went out and won
an event on the Nike Tour, a satellite of
the PGA Tour. The matter will be decided
next month by a Federal magistrate in Eugene, Ore.
If walking is indeed an integral part of
the

age of 50 to use carts, and nobody disputes that the Senior PGA Tour is golf, pure
and simple. Golf is not about walking from
shot to shot, it's about making shots. Don't
let anybody tell you differently. There are
perhaps two instances in the history of golf
where

sees. Martin,
who had been
a standout collegiate golfer
at Stanford,

can no longer

play golf if he 4
is forced to
walk from shot
to shot because of
the worsened condition of his circulatory
system. So, Martin became the first athlete to invoke the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) against a professional
sports organization, claiming that the
PGA, as an employer, must make "reasonable accomodations" for employees
with disabilities. After a federal court
judge issued a preliminary injuction

game of
golf, then Martin,
legally, hasn't a leg to stand
on. Allowing him to ride a cart would be
an unreasonable accomodation, akin to demanding that we give a one-legged linebacker a moped to meander the football
field with, or allowing a mute Broadway
performer to lip sync
actions which
would undermine the fabric of the industry. But the PGA allows golfers over the

walking
has added to the atmosphere of the game: when
Ken Venturi won the 1964 U.S. Open
while staggering through heat stroke, and
when Ben Hogan courageously struggled
to victory after a returning from a
devestating car crash. Walking from shot
to shot is about as integral to the game of
golf as sitting on the bench is to the game
of basketball. In the National Basketball
Association it is common to see players

with back injuries lying down on the sideline so that they can prevent pain and stay
in game shape; recently, players with leg
injuries have taken to riding stationary
bikes to keep their legs warm and allow
them to participate without risking further
injury. The NBA could argue that sitting
on the bench is a crucial thread in the fabric of the game, but it wisely does not. This
is the sort of reasonable
accomodation that the PGA is
being asked to make.
While riding in
a cart might
afford Martin
an advantage
in 100-degree
heat, that issue would be
null because
all
golfers
would have the
oppurtunity to use
carts in such circumstances. In the vast majority of tournaments, when
must
walk
four miles in approxigolfers
three
and
a
half
mately
hours, the pro golfers will opt to walk because they know
Martin has no advantage riding in his cart.
People do not go to golf tournaments to
watch golfers walk. The only walking that
is even regularly televised is the tournament
victor's triumphant march down the final

fairway. I am certain that the crowds will
be just as jubilant if they are allowed to
witness Casey Martin riding down the final fairway, triumphant despite his disability.

reports in the media. In the March
24, 1986, issue of Forbes, for example, Lang is reported to have
"guaranteed full tuition for any kid
in the class who could qualify for
college." However, according to the
June 1988 issue of The Washington Monthly, Lang is said to have
told students, "get into college, and
I promise I'll give you scholarships." And the November 25,1985,
issue of Time reports that Lang
"would give them each $2OOO to-;
ward college tuition with more
where that came from." Since there
is no audio documentation of
Lang's extemporaneous address ire
1981, the record can never be accurately substantiated.
The home page for Lang's I Have

Foundation
(www.ihad.org) perhaps also added
to the confusion. At least until January 12, 1998, well after the Dateline segment aired, the web page
read in part: "You've probably
heard the story. In 1981, a New
York businessman named Eugene
Lang was invited to speak to the
sixth grade at his old elementary
school in East Harlem. He came to
deliver an ordinary speech, but instead, on the spur of the moment,
he made an extraordinary offer:
Lang told the 61 children that if
they graduated from high school,
he would pay for all of them to go
to college." The last sentence has
recently been changed and now
reads: "Lang told the 61 children
that if they graduated from high
school, he wouldprovide financial
assistance to help them payfor college."
At press time, Lang was unavailable for comment, and as many are
quick to point out, it is difficult to
fault anyone for any act of philanthropy. The $5OO Lang reports to
have offered was simply a gift
meant to give hope to kids he felt
had gloomy futures. But where the
misunderstanding arose and how
hopeful these students still are, remains to be seen.

College and the Borough will
probably split equally.
Larry Shane, Chairman of the
Board of Managers, says that the
College first became interested in
the possibility of renovating the
business district after studying
different Philadelphia suburbs
and finding that they were not
attracting enough investment.
The administration became concerned that the College would
have a hard time attracting faculty to live in Swarthmore. They
are also worried about the lack
of housing for visiting parents.
Shane mentions the idea of investing in an inn using land

community, after which the College
hopes to make a final decision by
July.
According to Eldridge, Swarthmore took the unusual step of seeking an outside firm to conduct the
search because the position is one
that is largely focused on business
aspects of administering the College. Among the criteria for the position that theCollege has communicated to Isacson, Miller are a deep
understanding of the value ofalib-

eral arts education, an ability to
manage a complex office that links
the College to the rest of the world,
and experience in fundraising.
Eldridge suggests that the individual ultimately tapped for the
vice presidency will probably have
been employed in a comparable position at another college, private
business, or non-profit organization. "The vice president must understand and relate to external
populations. Yet what he or she
relates is what is happening on
campus. So the position is very
unique and important," says
Eldridge.

LIVING & THE ARTS
Institute Cultivates Intense Self-Exploration
by

Laura Cohen

9:40 A.M., January 13th, on my flight back to
Swarthmore I had doubts about returning to participate in the Multicultural Winter Institute. This meant

returning to school four days earlier than most of my
peers and staying in a strange room, in a strange dorm.
I envied those classmates whom I envisioned still
sleeping in their beds, able to relish four more days of
winter break. What should I expect from the Institute? I knew, of course, that it would be multicultural,
but what exactly does this mean? In a time when diversity and multiculturalism are sometimes nothing
more than buzz words to attract students to college
campuses, I was apprehensive about what I would find
behind the door of Kohlberg 115.
When I opened that door at 9 A.M. the following
morning, I found participants and facilitators eating
breakfast and making conversation. The room gradually filled with students, faculty, and staff: 40 faces,
some familiar and some new. What I didn't know
ithat morning was that three and a half days later, each
of us would have completed, or perhaps only begun, a
difficult and amazing journey.
This journey was sparked by eight full hours each
day of discussions and activities, in small and large
groups, centered around diversity, identity, power, and

gaining a better understanding of oppression in its
many forms, including racism, sexism, classism,
heterosexualism, ableism, and ageism. Dealing with
these issues is not always easy and demands intense
self-exploration which I found personally challenging and often emotionally draining. These are issues that affect every one of us in some way. Martin
Luther King, Jr., is appropriately quoted in the folder
given to all participants, "Injustice anywhere is a
threat to injustice everywhere. We are caught in an
inescapable network of mutuality... Whatever affects
one affects all indirectly."
At the Winter Institute, faculty, staff and students
from each class join in this mutuality to learn how
to be allies to one another. "It was good to hear the
viewpoints of people that you don't hear from [such
as faculty, staff, and students,]" says Lena Sze 'Ol.
She continued, "Everyone is almost a peer at the
Institute. It's like you're in the same boat. It sparked
good discussion." Ken Saragosa, Instructor in English Literature, comments, "I liked that it was open
to students, faculty, and staff members. It's unusual
to have forums where we can all interact equally.
It's valuable to have conversation about these issues
with other members of the campus community."
Breaking down walls among faculty, staff, and students is a first step towards building alliances to fight

Jeff Stetson's "The Meeting" imagines a clandestine encounter between Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
and Malcolm X, two of the most influential men of
our time. This thought-provoking play, set in a Harlem
hotel room in February of 1965, explores both the
public and private personas of King and X the conflicts in their ideologies, and their identities as leaders, fathers, husbands, and men. Stetson's "The Meeting" was presented this past Monday in celebration
of Dr. King.
King and X serve as nearly perfect foils of each other
both in origin and in ideology: city vs. country, nonviolent protest vs. self defense through any means,
Baptist vs. Muslim, etc. While one strives to integrate
shops and buses and to show Americans the folly of
racism, the other fights to own those same shops, to
drive the buses, and to free blacks from oppression.
Both are fighting for varying degrees of the same
thing, freedom, and against the same foe, racism, in
their own ways. King has taken the nonviolent approach "because it's right; I preach it because I'm a
man, a child of G0d..." and because "sometimes you
need to be able to ride the bus before you can drive it.
..
King, who advocates love, understanding, and
patience, sees civil rights legislation as a step in the
right direction while X sees it as part of the great white
lie, as an empty promise on a piece of paper. While
King pledges to wear whites down with "our capacity to suffer," X refuses to ask his people to take more
punishment and advocates aggression in the name of
self defense. Despite these differences, it is clear that
both these men seek the same sort of justice for their
people. This is perhaps what Stetson most successfully brings out: different as they may be, King and
X are first and foremost leaders of men. They want
to help their people create futures for their children
and live without fear and persecution.
This play made Dr. King and Malcolm X come to
life before my very eyes. Fictional though it may be,
I feel I left with a deeper understanding of these men,
the movements they represented, and their reasoning.
King and X were men, extraordinary men at that, but
not supermen. They were subject to the same feelings of hope, pain, and desperation that we are. What
sets them apart from most is theirdevotion to the cause
of freedom. I was genuinely moved by the play's eloquence, passion, and intelligence; 1 left wondering
what would have happened if this encounter had actually taken place, what would have been "accomplished if we had joined hands and pushed in the same

oppression. Justin Suh 'OO says, "I feel like I've
connected with this group of people in a really deep
and meaningful way. There was a lot of group unity".
However, the battle does not end when the Winter
Institute is over. The reality of what I learned at the
Institute is far beyond that which is printed in my
participant's folder. There is much focus on the next
step for everyone as individuals and members of a
community at Swarthmore and in the world. "What
you get from Winter Institute is something that
you're unaware of, but it makes a difference," says
Rafael Hinojosa 'OO, "It's not until you're walking
around campus, placed in environmental surroundings, that you see something totally relevant to Winter Institute." Suh continues, "Even though I' ve done
a let of thinking and discussing about these issues
before, it[the Institute] was nothing like I've ever
done before". Shelley Laws 'Ol agrees, "It was very
intense, and yet, a learning experience. It gave me a
different perspective on multicultural issues. I'm
very happy I decided to do it."
In a time when diversity and multiculturalism are
sometimes nothing more than buzz words to attract
students to colleges campus, the Swarthmore College Multicultural Winter Institute works to give
these words dimension and to give members of the
college community the power to make a change.

display at the List Gallery until February 15. The
showing is the culmination of a year and a half's work
on the part of Sandy Lin '9B who researched the life
of the influential painter, assembled the exhibit, and
finally introduced the collection with a gallery talk
on Thursday.
Born in New York in 1862, Davies became one of
the most important twentiethcentury American painters, as well as a fascinating private figure who led
two secret lives with two romantic interests. Davies
won success and recognition in his own lifetime, and
was an active patron among his contemporary artists, organizing exhibitions at Independence in 1908
and the Armory show in 1913. (The latter was the
first display of modern European art to America and
naturally proved to be a pivotal influence on American styles.) As an artist Davies was genuinely interested in experimentations with technique, working
with unconventional media such as tapestries. Mostly
Davies pursued etchings, a visual form that had not
yet been thoroughly explored in America in his time.
The prints currently on displayat the List Gallery
consist mostly of dry-point etchings, soft-ground
etchings, and lithographs. The heart of these techniques lies in deriving a print from markings on a
metal plate; the plate is either marked with ink, treated
in acid after carving through a soft ground surface,
or drawn on with an oily crayon and treated in water.
For the subject of these prints Davies chose the
female and male nude, often in classical scenes. Lin
pointed out the soft-ground etching Maenads (191819) as one of her favorites; the scene features two
nymph-figures and a languid youth stretched out
before an intricate, but slightly abstract wooded background. The etching process adds a delicate variance
to Davies's line, and the gentle curves he traces over

the figures gives them a graceful aspect. The aquatint
(a method of adding tone by sprinkling rosin powder
on the plate before printing) casts the picture in a green
and copper sheen. In Sea Maidens{ 1919), another softground etching with a similar subject, a row of beautiful female figures blends together slightly, this time
with the aquatint providing a soft wash of grays. Lin
also pointed out two other prints, taken from two states
of the plate, Toil of Three (1919-20). In the first state,
Davies' admirable technique of thick, dark strokes
gives boldness to the action of the figures. Lin offered the work as an example of Davies's tendency
toward "continuous composition," a method of using
line to express movement or a kind of choreography.
In the second state, Davies crops the picture and adds
shades of color that produce a hint of depth. In this
form, Lin sees the second state of the scene as "more
about shape relations" and "less about movement."
Etchings made in dry-point on zinc, like Bathing
Woman and Servant (1917) have sharper outlines and
barer forms; the voluptuous figure of the mezzotint
Venus (1927) takes on a smooth, almost ethereal quality.
Lin's role as a student curator of the exhibit is the
first such case in the history of the List Gallery. After she saw a similar exhibit at a Wellesley art museum, she proposed curating a selection from the
Swarthmore College collection to her advisor. In her
first experience as a curator, Lin chose the prints on
display from the nearly fifty that were available and
put together the exhibit with some aid from her advisor, colleagues, and friends. Her original research on
Davies's life and the history of his prints took her to
various research facilities such as Friends Library and
the library of the PMA. She also delved through
Davies's personal letters to his family as well as the
correspondence of Swarthmore administrators. The
prints can be traced back to the Benjamin West Society, founded by student Frederick Price, who was
pushing the cause of art to an unsympathetic administration.

Wag The Dog
Barks Up the
Wrong Tree
The
Wag
Dog,
the new political satire
by Barry Levinson, is a
movie entranced by its
own cleverness; this, unfortunately, renders it ineffective as anything
Altered States
other than a mildly amusPatrick Runkle
ing oddity.
Robert DeNiro stars as Charlie Green, a
political consultant brought in to do damage control after the president is accused of molesting a
young girl in the Oval Office ten days before the
election. He needs something to draw the public's
attention from the girl, so he flies to Los Angeles
and talks to a big-shot producer, Stanley Motss
(Dustin Hoffman), about creating some footage of
a fake war going on in some faraway land.
Of course, their scheme is hatched, and Motss
goes about filming some sad stuff about the terrible situation in Albania. Then, the press is given
a story about how the US went in to solve the Albanian conflict. Some complications arise, like
when their proposed war hero (Woody Harrelson)
turns out to be a violent rapist, but the press and
pubhc are fooled from day one.
I liked many individual scenes of Wag The Dog,
and I did laugh, but for the most part I thought the
movie seemed like 45 minutes ofmaterial stretched
over almost 2 hours. It's a tremendously unfocused
movie
lots of scenes go nowhere, and the end is
particularly lacking in a suitable climax or satisfying finale. Also, the film spends way too much
time trying to convince the audience that its own
set-up is plausible. I was ready to believe it, but
while Levinson spends so much time setting it up
and showing us how they did it, I kept wanting Wag
The Dog to move on and make another point. That
was not to be, however, because this is a movie
with only one idea to begin with.
The performances are generally good, and Dustin
Hoffman (who teamed with Levinson in Rain Man
and will also appear in Levinson's upcoming
Sphere) will probably get an Oscar nomination for
his work in this flick. Willie Nelson is especially
hilarious in a cameo role as a crazy country
songwriter who has to concoct something patriotic
a la "We Are The World."

Swimmers Drop Meet to Hopkins
After Tropical Island Interlude
by Helen Oliver
Returning to campus after 10 days of double practices in the Virgin Islands, the Swarthmore men's
and women's swimming teams faced a difficult meet
against Johns Hopkins on Wednesday. Still recovering from an unexpected dose of St. Cruzan hospitality, in addition to the standard physical strain of
competition, the swimmers were unable to prevail
against the larger Hopkins squad. By the end of the
evening, the women had been defeated 165-42 while
the men had bowed 138-67.
Despite the final scores several swimmers had
commendable performances. The men's 400 medley relay led off the meet with a win; Junior Ryan
Fruh's season-best butterfly leg highlighted the contributions of Andy Robbins '9B, Fred Gerson '99
and Carl Sanders '9B. Sanders also raced well in
the 200 free a few events later.

The extra efforts of the team's distance swimmers
paid off impressively against the Bluejays. Mari
McCrann 'OO paced herself to lifetime bests in both
the 1000 and 500 freestyle events. Molly Marino '9B
and Mark Friedberg '9B both posted fast times in the
200/500 and 500/1000 yard freestyles, respectively.
The breastroke events also proved to be solid in the
Garnet lanes. After gaining experience on a Division I
team in Hawaii last semester, Jenny Harvey '99 looked
strong in the water as she pushed herself to a quick
2nd place finish in the 200 yard distance. On the men's
side, Ted Scherer 'Ol was the team's only individual
winner with his effort in the 200 breast.
While the meet as a whole was a sobering evening
for the Swarthmore swimmers, they are now poised
and ready to rise to the challenge of Dickinson on Saturday. With a few more hard practices behind them
and renewed mental focus, the team promises to show
off their talent in the cool waters of Carlisle, PA.

Deaths Prompt NCAA Rule
Changes Affecting Wrestlers
by Jill Belding
In response to three deaths resulting from thepractice of cutting weight prior to matches, the NCAA
has revised regulations and created new rules governing the weight classes. While some of the
changes will not affect Swarthmore's wrestlers, at
least three immediately did. Each weight division
limit had 7 pounds added to it (i.e 118 lbs limit becomes 125 lbs). In addition the weigh-ins which
were often done the day before competition now
must occur no more than two hours prior. The rule
that had the most impact on Swarthmore's wrestlers was that a "wrestler may compete only in
weight classes in which he competed on or before
January 7 of this season."
During first semester, Alejandro Montero and Pete
Balvanz had been competing at a higher weight
class, 177 lbs and 158 lbs respectively, than they
intended to during second semester. On January 9th,
Montero and Balvanz wrestled in their appropriate
divisions, 167 lbs and 150 lbs. The new NCAA regulations were announced on January 13th, setting

Despite coming off a second place Centennial finish last season, the men's basketball team has
struggled to an 0-14 start on the year. The leadership
and experience that left with the graduation of five
of the top six players has thus far proven difficult to
overcome. With 12 of these losses coming on the
road, the Garnet are looking forward to playing four
of their next five games at home.
The Garnet opened up the Spring semester with
threeroad games. The Garnet dropped a 75-51 decision to Division I Yale. Tim Schofield '99 led the
squad with 15 points and 8 boards in the January 5
loss. At the Union College Classic, the Garnet opened
by playing Skidmore. Led by Schofield's 25 points,
the Garnet hung tough initially, but could not find
victory and finished the game on the wrong end of a
86-69 decision. In the consolation game against
Union, the Garnet were reeling from the previous
night's loss and never got out of the starting block as
they fell 82-38.
With renewed vigor, the Garnet prepared for their
first home game in ten contests against top-ranked
Washington College last Thursday. The Garnet once
again faltered at the start and fell behind 11-0. But
Swarthmore countered with three pointers from JJ
Purdy '99, Greg Holtmeier 'OO and Cassidy
Westbrook 'OO to knot the score at 14. Washington's
potent offense then broke the game open over the

next 14 minutes taking a 52-32 halftime lead.

Yet Swarthmore once again got hot and closed to
within 60-47, though that would be as close as they
would get The losing streak continued after a 86-64
loss. Holtmeierposted career highs in points (15) and
rebounds (8) with Purdy chipping in 14 points and 5

boards.

On Saturday, the Garnet travelled to Ursinus for
yet another road game. However, Swarthmore failed
to stop the Bears, who took al3 point halftime lead.
And though the Garnet rallied late in the game and
were within striking distance, they could not reach
victory and fell 80-71.
Wednesday night, the Garnet travelled to
Muhlenberg, who were looking for revenge following Swarthmore's thrilling playoff victory there last
year. The Garnet once again fell behind early and
struggled to a 42-28 halftime deficit, en route to a
80-65 loss. Tim Schofield lit up the scoreboard with
a career-high 33 points. Mike Schall '99 added 12
points and Holtmeier helped out with 10 points.
Swarthmore hosts Western Maryland tomorrow afternoon at 3:00 to start a string of home contests.
There is hope that the friendly confines of Tarble
Pavilion will spark the team to its first victory. With
eight more Conference games scheduled, and continual improvement from the younger players, the
Garnet have the ability to surprise many teams provided the team can work its way out of their current
dismal slump.

January 7th as the deadline. Montero and Balvanz petitioned for an appeal to allow them to wrestle in the
lower classes for the remainder of the season. Tuesday, January 20, Montero and Balvanz were both
granted permission to continue to wrestle in their intended classes.
Over winter break, Swarthmore wrestlers returned
early to compete in eight contests. They also competed
in two meets immediately before leaving. The effect
of these contests, 5 wins and 5 losses, is indicitive of
the team's balanced overall record of 6-8. Many wrestlers gave fine performances during the break, including Matt Kahn who won, by a pin, his first collegiate
match.
On Wednesday night, Swat won convincingly against
Valley Forge Military Academy, 33-15. Having been
cleared by the NCAA the day before for their weight
classes to be allowed, Balvanz and Montero competed
in and both pinned their opponents. Adding a pin to
the list was Frank Yeo in the 125 lbs division. Matt
Kahn won his match in the 165 lbs division with a
decision by points, while Sam Picard (133 lbs) and
Sean Lewis (heavyweight) both received forfeits.

The Garnet squad takes a break during practice. Varsity coach Shibles cited the team's dedication
to practices as a factor in their impressive conference record.

Women's B-Ball Improves Record
by Jean Quinn
Playing extremely well in the series of matches
over break, the Varsity Women's Basketball team
improved theirrecord to 4-7 overall (1-4 in the conference). The Garnet routed Bryn Mawr and had a
thrilling come-from-behind victory against first time
opponent Del Valley. Two close conference games
against Gettysburg and Dickinson were testament
to the strength and heart of this year's team.
The team returned to campus January 2 and had a
week of strenuous practices before enjoying their
first competition against Del Valley. Coach Adrienne
Shibles laudedher players for their dedication, "Winter break is a gigantic sacrifice for the players on the
team. It is a time when they could be home with
their families, and yet they commit to their teammates and their school and return to play basketball."
Against Del Valley, the Garnet struggled in the first
half. Down by ten points, the Garnet regrouped during the second half and an amazing defensive intensity propelled the team to a 51 -45 win. Holly Barton
'99 made 5 of 10 three pointers in the second half
and led the Garnet with 17 points. Kristen English
'Ol poured in 15 points and dished out 4 assists,
while Heather Marandola 'Ol added 11 points and
grabbed 13 rebounds.
Contributing to the defensive effort were Jean
Quinn '99 and Michelle Walsh, with 14 and 11
boards a piece. Shibles commented, "We came out
in the second half expecting to win the game. I have
definitely noticed a change in the attitude of the players on the team. They know they can win, and are
not settling for anything less than their very best."
Against conference foe Gettysburg, the Garnet
came out strong, entering the locker room at the

break with a slim lead. However, the Bullets lit it up
from the floor in the second half, hitting 52% from
the field and defeated Swat, 63-52. Marandola had
16 points, Barton 13, and English 10.
Bryn Mawr fell easily to the Garnet, 58-28.
Marandola paced the team with 16points. Quinn had
8 points and 6 boards, while Walsh pulled down 7
rebounds. The only blemish of the evening was that
point guard English injured her knee while diving
for a ball on the sidelines.
In a game similar to the one against Del Valley,
Swarthmore fell behind to Dickinson early, but recovered from a large half-time deficit to take the contest down to the final seconds of play. Shutting down
the other team's outside shooters, the Garnet played
a stellar second half, on both the offensive and defensive ends.
Marandolaand Walsh each finished with 15 points
and 12 and 10 boards respectively. Before departing
for a semester in Russia, Barton poured in 11 points.
Quinn led the team on the boards with 14 and
Marandola was named to the Conference's weekly
honor roll for her fine offensive performances.
Deirdre Downey 'Ol commented, "The Dickinson
and Gettysburg losses were rough because we were
so close to winning both. Everyone was physically
and emotionally drained, especially after the
Dickinson loss." Fran Smith said, "Winter break was
a fabulous timefor us to really bond as a team, both
on and off the court. Without the pressures of work,
we were able to relax and just concentrate on our
team and playing basketball," a comment proved valid
to anyone who caught a glimpse of the team in action. The Garnet will travel to Ursinus and Western
Maryland before returning to Tarble for a home game,
Tuesday, Jan. 27 at 7:00 pm, when they take on the
defending conference champs from Muhlenberg.
