John Fischer explains to both students and staff how to get into the culinary world. For Fischer, it was first through experiences
gained while bartending at Phi Psi.
BY JACQUELINE SMALL
jsmall2@swarthmore.edu

It is not often that Swarthmore
students envision a future in a busy
restaurant kitchen, but John Fischer
'Bl has spent his career in the culinary world as a chef and a sommelier.
Though he is now employed as an
associate professor in Table Service
at the Culinary Institute of America,
the premier cooking school in the
country, he has also written three
books, "At Your Service: A Hands-On
Guide to the Professional Dining
Room," "Bistros and Brasseries:
Recipes and Reflections on Classic
Cafe Cooking" and "Cheese."
On Monday, Oct. 4, in SCI 104,
Fischer spoke to a group of about 15
students and members of the faculty
about His experiences in the restaurant industry, and gave advice to several
audience
members
who
expressed interest in a career in the
culinary world. He was invited by
Career Services.
Fischer began the talk by giving a
brief biography of himself. A psychology major at Swarthmore, he got
his start serving people as a bartender at Phi Psi. He intended to
enter the advertising field after graduation, but found that jobs were
scarce. "No one was hiring in advertising in the early 80's," Fischer said.
Instead, he found a job bartending,
then enrolled at the Culinary
Insititue of America after a year on
their wait list.
At the time, almost all applicants
had to wait at least that long, because
it was then the only culinary school
in the country.

He specialized in beverage management and now teaches courses in
his specialty at the Institute.
"Essentially, I'm a booze specialist,"
he said.
During his education at the
Institute, he said that his parents
were skeptical about his choices, and
thought he would be unable to make
a good living. But since then, he said,
it has become a much more respected
career path.
"Cooking and food are part of our
world and part of our culture now,"
Fischer said.
Jennifer Barrington, assistant
director of Career Services, said that
she does not know the exact number
of Swarthmore students who pursue
culinary careers, but she is aware
that several have.
"I think there's something very
'Swarthmore' about it in that chefs
need to have creativity and entfepre-

neurship."
Fischer agreed and said that many
stereotypical Swarthmore traits are
important in the restaurant business. "It's not all about the food and
the flavors, or all about carrying 10
glasses in one hand, it's about nurturing people. Everything else can be
learned, but not nurturing."
Fischer also talked about the
kinds of personalities that work well
as chefs. At first, he joked that "bipolar" personalities make successful
chefs, but then said the opposite can
also be true.
"It helps to be the calm in the
storm. You should really know what
you're doing so you can be calm. A
healthy form of OCD works well, too.
You need to have attention to detail,
preparedness. You shouldn't hate

October 7, 2010

people, and you should want to enjoy
taking care of people," he said.
Several students asked questions
about how to enter the field from the
ground up. Fischer suggested watching quality cooking shows for fun. He
advised the group to avoid Rachael
Ray and Paula Dean, cringing at the
memory of Dean's hamburger with
donuts as buns, and instead to opt for
Alton Brown or PBS shows. He also
recommended enrolling in a culinary
school, though not one affiliated with
Cordon Bleu, since those schools are
now owned by a for-profit company
and are unreliable.
Prospective chefs can also try to
work at a real restaurant, preferably
an eatery from their local city's top
50 Zagat-rated restaurants, before
continuing a formal education. He
suggested that they should get an
entry-level job at an eatery and offer
to work for free.
"They'll probably have to pay you
for labor law reasons, but they'll like
you for offering to work for free," he
said.
Ben Schwartz 'l2, who attended
the talk and asked Fischer for advice
starting his career in Berkeley,
California, said in an e-mail that he
loves to cook, and that the talk made
him seriously consider it as a possible career path.
"[He] was a delight to talk to and
hear from. He was a thoroughly
entertaining speaker, with a great
sense of humor, and did a great job of
tailoring his talk to the audience,"
Schwartz said in an e-mail. "I'm not
sure that I'll wind up pursuing a culinary career, but I find myself more
and more drawn to the idea of culinary school after his talk."

The college is now ready to launch
its strategic planning process, aimed at
enhancing the rigorous and supportive
academic environment. Organizers are
hopeful that there will be active participation by "the community.
The Board of Managers approved
the process in a meeting last weekend,
in response to a series ofrecommendations about how to structure and
implement developments. The procedure will start by gathering ideas and
suggestions from the Swarthmore community for the next three to four
months, and will continue with various committees discussing different
areas of the planning process. Strategic
planning will draw out Swarthmore's
future in 10 years, and set forth several
major projects. Previously, those projects have included the construction of
new instructional buldings, among
other things.
"I hope students will participate
and start thinking about what they
think are the right questions to help
develop
Swarthmore,"
President
Rebecca Chopp said.
The task force's recommendations,
titled "Recommendationsfor Planning
for the Future of Swarthmore," and
other materials are available for students to read on the strategic planning
website, sp.swarthmore.edu. Also
available is a space called "histories of
the future," which is open for students
to share their visions of Swarthmore
in 2020.
There are also lists of strategic planning committee members and details
on the four working groups that each
concentrate on one of four areas of
focus: the mission, values and goals of
the college; the future of knowledge
and the ways in which knowledge is
taught and learned; admissions, access
and affordability; and alumni engagement and development.
The groups will start meeting
immediately to gather information on
student trends in the U.S. Examples of
• such information include what kinds
of majors students want, what activities they are interested in and what
kind of space they need. Other questions to consider are how students balance, interdisciplinary knowledge and
the effect of technology on education
and development on campus.
There will be three main events as
starting points for the strategic planning process. The first is a faculty
meeting on Oct. 8 that will cover preliminary thoughts on the education.
Following this will be an all staff meeting on Oct. 20, which will cover the college's key values, opportunities, challenges and the role of the staff in supporting Swarthmore's educational mission.
More information about the two
meetings is available on the strategic
planning website.
The fmal event is a fireside chat
with students to be held on Oct. 25.
Dean of Students Liz Braun expressed
the greatest enthusiasm for this event,
where Braun and Professor of
Economics Stephen O'Connell will
facilitate
more
discussion
of

October 7 f 2010

Swarthmore's key values, opportunities and challenges.
"We're looking to get as much
involvement from community, especially from students, as possible,"
Braun said. "It's going to be a really
exciting process and I feel very lucky
to be here at Swarthmore during this
time."
But Chopp also highlighted the
importance of looking beyond college
boundaries.
non-profit
institution,
"Every
including Swarthmore, has to pause
and look at the big picture and ask
itself what are the internal and external forces at work," Chopp said. "We
cannot ignore the broader world while
focusing on the students and the effects
of teaching."
As such, the Strategic Planning
Council will attempt to continue internal conversations concerning students
and the college, but it has also asked
the community to reflect on what they
see as outer forces on education.
There has not yet been an official
meeting to discuss the plans, but the
council will undergo a process of planning new developments for the school,
starting now and concluding on the
tentative end date of December 201 L
Braun is part of the overseeing
Strategic Planning Council. She is also
co-convener, along with Maurice
Eldridge, vice president for college and
community relations and executive
assistant to the president, of the working group focusing on the college's mission, values and goals. Braun said that
having "focal points" would be especially important to the group.
"The broadness of our working
group's topic is a challenge," Braun
said. "We'll have to think about the big
picture but also narrow in on key areas
by looking through data-rich information."
During February and March, the
four working groups will form recommendations, which they will then submit to the steering committee over the
summer. Once the steering committee
reviews these recommendations, they
will draft an initial plan to turn in to
the overseeing Strategic Planning
Council for its approval, after which it
will go to the board of managers in a
fall meeting in 201 L Assuming the
board approves the plan, it will then be
taken out to the community for further
discussion.
Chopp was hopeful that the Ad Hoc
Financial Planning Group, created in
response to the "Great Recession,"
would hold fundraisers and encourage
donations from alumni, parents, and
donors for funds to help fuel strategic
planning.

Overall, one of the central goals that
the Strategic Planning Council is
working toward achieving is maintaining Swarthmore's high-quality academics and supportive environment.
"I would hope that Swarthmore
remains at the heart of things," Reed
Coke 13, a student member of the overseeing committee, said. "I wish it
would remain as vigorous, challenging
and relevant to the contemporary
world as it is now. It should continue
being a place where students really get
to pursue their passion."

Queer activist criticizes gay marriage campaigns

Equality: Queer Critiques of Gay
Marriage," an anthology that evaluates the, discourse of the national gay
marriage campaigns in America,
Conrad challenged the current views
of equality during his lecture.
"We need to open up space to actually talk about and imagine ourselves
in a world differently. Instead of seeking inclusion in the status quo, we
should actually be seeking for more
just and equitable ways of being in the
world," Conrad said.
the
Promoting
self-published
"Against Equality: Queer Critiques of
Gay Marriage" at the lecture, Conrad
expressed hope that this anthology of
texts would spark conversation to
revive the queer political imagination.
All texts were taken from Against
Equality, an online archive founded by
Conrad that aims to challenge the rhetoric of equality and to force its visitors
to question to what they are seeking to
be equal and whether that is a worthy
goal.
"The people amongst the collective
have decided that the framework of
equality that exists is problematic and
oppressive," Conrad said. "Right now
there's a sort of monolithic voice from
mainstream gay and lesbian organizations when there are actually these
critical and contending voices."
According to Conrad, they decided
to put together a book not only because
the work will be more credible and
legitimate but also so that those LGBT
in areas without access to the internet
and Against Equality can read the
work.
"The essays will be published along
side striking visuals specially commissioned for the anthology and our hope
is that releasing them as a published
book allows our critiques to reach a
greater audience. The cultural lives of
books are very different from that of
online texts and the credibility that
comes with printed matter still far
exceeds the weight of blogging," the
Against Equality collective said on
their website.
Although Conrad has a full-time job
working in the mental health field
with young people, since last year, he
has considered his role as an activist
to be his unpaid labor.
In the aftermath of the botched gay
marriage campaign in Maine last year,
Conrad formed Against Equality to critique mainstream gay and lesbian politics.
"It came out of my response emotionally to that campaign which was
run really poorly," Conrad said during
the lecture. "It began as a personal
project to work through my grievances
and I quickly realized that it wasn't

In his lecture, Conrad also highlighted the misleading nature of the
current language in gay marriage
campaigns that equates the right to
love with the right to marry. He
believes that marriage as it is defined
in our society today is about social
contracts to gain health benefits and
property rights, not love.
Conrad and the rest of the Against
Equality group also see the discourse
around gay marriage as a distraction
from core issues in the gay community
today, including issues such as "Don't
ask, don't tell" and hate crimes in
school that are leading children and
teenagers to commit suicide.
Also in the lecture, Conrad posed
the question of whether there should
be an equal stake in intrinsically
oppressive matters, or if strategizing
to come up with other ways to meet
material needs will be more effective.
Conrad considers Against Equality to
be a small project that attempts to
address these questions.
Conrad also had comments on the
political scene surrounding the queer
community.
"I'm so tired of the working class
being totally invisible and having
their voice shut out," Conrad said.
"And I'm tired of the gay marriage
rhetoric of inclusion because it doesn't
work and it doesn't add up for poor
people."
Erika Slaymaker 'll, co-chair of the
Queer Symposium, which takes place
in the spring, saw that inviting Conrad
to lecture at Swarthmore would be
beneficial for the entire community.
"I think it's really important that
we have fabulous queer events on campus that have lots of different ideas
about what it means to be queer,"
Slaymaker said. "I think the political
aspect of the word queer is really
important as is making sure those conversations are going on on campus."

StuCo postpones decision on Dash for Cash
BY MENGHAN JIN

mjin2@swarthmore.edu

Elizabeth Hamilton '.12 and
Dennis Fan 'll, captains of the
women's and men's rugby teams,
attended the Student Council
meeting again this week to
request that StuCo send out a
survey to the entire student body
for input on the possibility of
bringing back Dash for Cash.
This biannual tradition in which
members of the rugby teams
streak through Parrish was discontinued last year due to the
participation of the men's team
in an unrelated streaking incident.
"We would like to hold Dash
for Cash again," Hamilton said.
"It was a lot of fun; we'd like to
make some money, but we realize
that it can be a problematic event
for many people."
According to Hamilton, Myrt
Westphal, Associate Dean for
Student Life, advised the rugby
teams to go through Student
Council first before going to the

administration.
"She seemed to think that if
after we had this survey and possibly had some discussion
if
then Student Council was comfortable saying to the deans that
...

you would approve Dash for
Cash, then we'd be in a stronger
position talking to them ourselves," Hamilton said.
However, because not all
members were present at the
meeting, StuCo was unable to
vote on whether or not to send
out a survey on rugby's behalf.
Deivid Rojas 'll, StuCo vice president, suggested Hamilton and
Fan come back with a written
resolution on how they want
StuCo to help at the next meeting.

Other members, though,
found some shortcomings to the
efficiency of the discussions
with theBoard. "I just didn't see
how it would shape up in the
real
world
and
what
Swarthmore can actually do
about it," Student Events
Advisor Luis Penate 'l3 said.
"They were actually a bit cynical, I would say."
StuCo will send out an e-mail
to all students recapping their
experience at the Board meeting.

This being his third Board of
Managers meeting, Rojas found
the meeting to be the best in student-board interaction.

State of televisions on campus
Rojas sent out an e-mail last
week to all Resident Advisors

asking for an update on the con-

dition of televisions in their
halls. Most RAs have responded
and currently, only one dorm
has functioning cable, and the
televisions and DVD players in
some dorms are defective.
StuCo will-contact Stu Hain,
Vice President for Facilities and
Services, about the next steps to
take in repairing televisions on
campus.

Aerobics
Leila Bengali 'll and Adriana
Popa 'l2 requested funding for a
Fall II section of Aerobics. Due
to recent budget cuts, the administration was forced to reduce
the PE class to just once each
semester.

"Aerobics is very, very heavily attended," Bengali said. "It's
very popular; everyone I talked

Next weekend, Rojas will

though, Bengali and Popa would
need to figure out logistics with
the PE department and StuCo.
But they were unsure of whether
they could work that out before
the Fall II section, which starts
right after Fall break.
Ben Hattem 'l2, Financial

Policy Representative, suggested
for the two to form an aerobics
group and go through SBC to get
funding. "The way to go about
this in the long-term is to get a

charter group and an instructor

budget. Those are both pretty
straightforward SBC [processes]," he said.

PE credit for the group will
have to be worked out with the
athletics department, but StuCo
advised Bengali and Popa to
work with SBC in the meantime
to form an aerobics group. '

Exploring the French countryside like a Parisian

Maki Somosot
Small But Classe

Vacationing during the
weekend is a beloved and
often fiercely defended
right for the French. With
its two-day-long promise of
rest and relaxation, the
weekend takes on almost
proportions
mythic
in
France. Indeed, a colloquial
phrase has even been
coined to capture this phenomenon: partir en weekend, which means to take
the weekend off, in general,
for a short holiday.
For city dwellers, la

hassle as a dream holiday destination.
In terms of logistics, booking the train tickets from
Paris to Trouville-Deauville in Normandy was straightforward enough. From there we had to catch two different
regional buses to arrive at our final destination.
Upon arrival at Trouville-Deauville, we had no trouble
making our first bus connection to Le
\
v
Havre, a major city in northern
Normandy. The next bus connection to
Fecamp, a smaller town further north,
was just as uneventful as the previous one. Contrary to our worst fears,
it had been an efficient journey,
with no massive nuisances. It
was too good to be true for firsttime travelers in the French

France profonde, the "deep

countryside.

France" of the countryside, is often the preferred destination. La France profonde is mythic in its own right, evoking
archetypal scenes of unspoiled beaches, sprawling green
pastures, quaint traditional villages and simple, rural
lifestyles in the collective French consciousness. It is a perfect respite for city-bred Parisians needing to escape from
the daily grind of the metropolis.
My friend and I were more than ready ourselves to hightail it out of Paris after a month of intensive French sociopolitical courses. We decided to hit up the beaches of
Normandy, a region only two hours west of Paris by train,
for our vacation.
Globally known for its beaches' involvement in the
Normandy landings ofWorld War 11, Normandy also boasts
an impressive culinary heritage of seafood, apple cider and
camembert cheese, alongside a magnificent landscape of
cliffs, coastal beaches and villages. Due to its proximity to
Paris, Normandy is a favorite getaway spot for native

Parisians. Luckily for us students with small pockets, it
also happens to be a budget-friendly location. In the real,
lazy spirit of vacances, we decided to skip the D-Day monuments and instead settled on the northern coastal village of
Etretat, acclaimed for its stunning beachfront cliffs facing
the English Channel.
No matter how charming la France profonde seemed to
be, we were wary of the stereotype that the country could
be more difficult to navigate than the city. We had heard
about the notorious inconveniences that befall travelers in
the French countryside,, such as nonsensical regional
transportation, inexplicable time delays and the absence of
the Internet, pedestrian sidewalks and clean toilets. La
France profonde has been stereotyped as much as a hellish

And indeed, it was. We s**j
had chosen a hotel located in
between Fecamp and Etretat,
thinking it would be possible to
explore both towns on foot just
£
like in Paris. In fact, without a
car, we were forced to commune with
la France profonde in the rain and the
cold.
On an isolated dirt road off the main
highway, we trampled past endless
farmlands and grassy plains in search
of our distant hotel. The only sign of civilization present was the occasional rundown trailer, a tent inhabited by campers
or the field of ogling cows with hostile

our trip, but where was the damn bread? "It's 20 minutes
away by car," the owner of the hotel informed us helpfully.
Dinner was not served on Sunday nights either. Hungry
and gloomy, we decided to take a stroll along the cliffs,
which were impressive to behold even on an empty stomach. Passing farmland after farmland, I seriously pondered
,
stealing corn husks and kidnapping a cow for
\
dinner.
\
The possibility of shame aside, the
other option available was to beg for food
from the other hotel lodgers. Thanks to
the Samaritan kindness of two German
tourists, we were able to eat leftover
bread and cheese.
It was a less-than-ideal start to our
long-idealized vacation. The village
was beautiful, but a logistical impos*-~—sibility without a car to move ourselves around. We left the charming
hotel in the middle of nowhere the
next day for the town of Etretat, our

Etretat was the idyllic bucolic
escape that we had been seeking in

expressions.

"These are xenophobic cows,"
my friend remarked about their

change of demeanor. "Don't make any sudden movements."
We finally arrived at the charming little hotel in the

middle of nowhere, a kilometer and a half away from the
highway. There was wi-fi access, functional heating, excellent bathroom facilities and even cable TV. It was impeccably suited to modern standards. Only the quintessential
boulangerie (bakery) was nowhere to be found in the surrounding village.

In France, the absence of a boulangerie that .supplies
bread indicates the most extreme countryside possible. We
were at the heart of la France profonde, which apparently
gave us access to the Internet and broadcast TV, but no
bread. We expected to confront stereotypical hassles during

the first place. We hiked the renowned
cliffs, marveled at the breathtaking
seascape, drank apple cider and
watched too many American TV
shows dubbed in French. Paris
seemed too distant to register in our
minds. The town had all the modern
conveniences of wi-fi, cable TV, and
most importantly, several boulangeries. With the presence of bread
restored, our wandering souls could

finally rest in peace.
Despite having spent one stereotypical night in the middle of nowhere, our holiday did not otherwise fulfill the
common stereotypes about the French countryside. The
basic infrastructure exists. The regional buses are cheap
and reliable for the most part, albeit often populated by old

French mesdames and their pets.
However, it will do wonders to plan and research for a
trip well in advance before heading off- into la France profonde. A French or Francophone companion will be a lifesaver, as will a car.
And stock up on bread just in case.

bronchitis, but that's getting a bit pretenpotential
tious.

Another thing you have is a mouse.
Everyone at Swarthmore has a mouse.
No one is allowed to feel as though his or
her personal angst is something unique
simply because it involves a cold or a
mouse. My roommate and I quite like our
mouse, actually
we call it Leslie and
extend the basic hospitality of not trying
to kill it. We have yet to achieve the same
sort of affection for our colds, but we'll
work on it because everybody has a cold,
and if yours is called Jenny, it's got to be

that much easier to deal with.
The point is, if you want your angst to
be unique, it's got to involve something
a rhinoceros, for
really dramatic
instance. If a rhinoceros just scurried out
from under your bed and into your cereal box, you've got real trouble. That's the
sort of thing that's objectively worth
grumbling about.
Imagine it: "I just spent seventeen
hours in the library basement," someone
complains, "and all the dust made my

bronchitis act up, but I couldn't go back
to my room because it's full of mice. The
mice have made themselves cups of tea
and set up discussion groups on
Descartes all over my bed." And you say,
"Oh yeah? Well, there's a rhinoceros in
my room." That would be impressive. It
might even be worth a call to Public
Safety. I wonder whether or not Public
Safety is equipped to deal with that kind
of call. It's something to consider; one
can never be sure what will turn up
under one's bed around here.
I decided the other day that it would'
be a ridiculously good idea to sit in my
hallway and ask passersby what they
would do if they found a rhinoceros in
their room. I strongly recommend trying
this in your own hallways in the name, at
the very least, of moving boldly beyond
pleasantries. I received a variety of
responses ranging from, "talk to it reasonably," and "befriend it" to something
vague about procuring a saw or calling
the zoo as well as quite a few instances of
people ignoring me and walking quickly
past me.
I think all of this demonstrates three

October 7, 2010

things: L Some of us at Swarthmore have
a lot of faith in the good will of rhinoceroses 2. Public Safety should establish a
protocol for this situation 3. Some others
of us need to get more sleep before we are
released back into our hallways or
allowed to speak with anyone.
That leads me neatly to another statement I can make definitively about you,
the Swarthmore student: along with having mice and a cold, you are profoundly

then get off the train at 49th Street. The
last stop on the Media-Elwyn line
before entering the Center City fare
zone, 49th Street Station represents the
southwest corner of the University City
District, the area of West Philadelphia
between 50th Street and the University
of Pennsylvania and Drexel University.
Twenty years ago, visitors were illadvised to cross the street west of
Penn's campus edge; for better or
worse, gentrification
which is in no
small part the result of the universities'
purchase of many local apartment
buildings for use as student residences
has now pushed this line out to 50th
Street. While wandering late at night in
this area is still not recommended, the
Clark Park neighborhood is an excellent place to spend a weekend morning
or afternoon, whether you want to
study, explore or eat.

Clark Park, at the edge of the
University of the Sciences campus at

43rd and Baltimore/Chester, is a popular community park where both the
people-watching and food receive high
marks. Instead of exploring Penn or
Drexel, why not explore the area where
a mix of academics and locals live?
Clark Park is home to Philadelphia's
largest year-round market, a free
Shakespeare festival in late August and
monthly flea markets throughout the
warmer weather months. The park
itself is divided into north and south
halves by Chester Avenue. The north
half, known as Park A, fills the space
between Baltimore and Chester, while
Park B
home of the jungle gym
runs along Chester between 43rd and
45th Streets (Park A is closed for construction on August 9th and will
remain closed until November, returning to full function next spring).
To get from 49th Street Station to
Clark Park, exit the station via the
west/right-hand stairs or ramp, turn
right once you reach the road level and
walk across the road bridge to the intersection of 49th & Chester Avenue.
Continue straight on Chester until you
reach 45th Street, the west edge of the
park. Most of the non-numbered streets
in this area are avenues, indicating
their non-cardinal (and often non-linear) arrangement. Center City is
delightfully straightforward in its
north-south east-west regularity; in
this area, by contrast, it can be hard to
find your bearings. North of Baltimore
Avenue, the familiar grid of Market,

mark

chin

Chestnut, Walnut and Spruce reappears. South of Baltimore, the avenues

run northeast-southwest, and the numbered streets northwest-southeast.
Crossing numbered streets in descending order will eventually lead to the
edge of Penn.
The area west of Perm is home to
many immigrant communities which
have blessed it with a wealth of relatively inexpensive dining choices.
While the area is not without pricey
restaurants, it is overall more embracing of students' budgets. Within a fiveblock radius ofClark Park, one can find
Indian chaat (Desi Chaat House, 501 S.
42nd St.), vegan, vegetarian and raw
delicacies (Atiya Ola's Spirit First
Foods, 4505 Baltimore Ave.), modern
takes on comfort food (Rx, 4443 Spruce
St.), molecular gastronomy (Marigold
Kitchen, 501 S. 45th St.), and most of the
city's Ethiopian restaurants (try Ethio
Cafe & Restaurant, 225 S. 45th St.;
Abyssinia, 229 S. 45th St.; or Dahlak,
there are several
4708 Baltimore Ave.
others in the area), in addition to
restauramts serving West African,
Vietnamese and Thai food.
The Green Line Cafe at 43rd and
Baltimore serves Fair Trade coffee, and
their location on 44th and Locust has
live music on the weekends. On a nice
day, Earth Cup Cafe's patio on 45th
between Osage & Pine is hard to beat
non-coffee drinkers will appreciate
their honey steamer and hot tea drink
of mixed teas, honey and citrus juices.
For people watching on Baltimore
Avenue, fresh lemonade and a reliably
good sandwich, stop in at Milk & Honey
Market (4425 Baltimore Ave.), which
strives to embody the corner store of a
past time (though its execution of that
concept hardly renders it a five-anddime).

Milk & Honey Market and the
Mariposa Food Co-Op (4726 Baltimore

April, as well as Thursdays from -3 to 7
p.m. May through November. In addition to the produce, here you can find
Amish baked goods, fresh cider, local

cheeses and cut flowers. The Clark Park
Farmers' Market is significantly larger
than the Swarthmore Farmers' Market;
the sheer number of varieties of heirloom apples and winter squash found
here throughout the fall is seldom
found elsewhere in Philadelphia. For a
cheap, quality breakfast or lunch, stop
by the- psychedelic food truck with a
consistently long line and get a taste of
Honest Tom's Tacos (specifically, the
breakfast tacos) for $2.50 each.
April through October, the Uhuru
Solidarity Movement hosts flea markets
in the park. While these markets certainly have their fare share of old shoes
and dusty lamps, they also function as a
small-scale crafts festival, where local
artisans sell paintings, pottery, soaps
and other wares. Food vendors vary,
but African food and fried chicken are
consistently available. The next market
will be on October 16th, and it will be
the last of the 2010 season.
University
City
and
West
Philadelphia are peppered with beautiful churches and mosques; the most
noticeable and proximate to Clark
Park, along this route, is St. Francis de
Sales Roman Catholic Parish on 47th
and Springfield Avenue
it's a significant visual landmark to the west of
Chester Street. Its tiled domes and blue
entry columns are also visible from
Baltimore Avenue.
The Clark Park neighborhood is not
a shopping mall. It is a place where people live, work, eat and relax. It is treelined streets and Super 7s, halal
butcheries and old homes with covered
porches. This is still an urban area, and
still Philadelphia, but you truly get the
sense that people live here. It is
absolutely worth exploring
if you're
feeling particularly adventurous, walk
all the way up to Chestnut or Market,
and see how much more you'll find. The
49th Street Station is only served by the
Media-Elwyn Line, so take advantage of
it.

Name: Rachel Buurma
Title: Assistant Professor of English Literature
From: Summit, NJ
Current Residence: Philadelphia, PA
What She's Wearing:
"I am wearing a black sweater from Uniqlo," Buurma
said. Her grey and white shirt-dress is Sibel Saral, which
she bought at the Philadelphia Barney's CO-OP. Buurma
gave birth to her new daughter towards the beginning of
summer and is wearing Isabella Oliver leggings, which
she bought during her pregnancy. "The boots are Loeffler
Randall," Buurma said. "I saw them in Vogue, like, three
years ago and 1... stalked them on the Internet for another year." Her gold chain bracelet was the chain on her
great-grandmother's pocket watch and her black hemp
bracelet is from Sugarcube in Philadelphia.
How She's Describes Her Style:
"I like to stick to [a] neutral color palette," Buurma
said. "I like interesting shapes, and despite what I'm wearing today, I really like tailored, structuredpieces ofclothing." Buurma is a stickler for proportion and balancing
baggy and loose with sleek and slim fits. "My favorite prothe high boot with something on top,"
portions are
Buurma said, adding that her favorite outfit is pairing a
dress with boots.
Despite being pregnant for most of last year, Buurma
tried toijpar as many of her own non-maternity clothes.
"Most of the clothes I wore were clothes that I already
had. They just came to fit me differently," Buurma said.
...

Where She Shops:
"I tend to do a lot of shopping online," Buurma said.
She frequents the L.A.-based Creatures of Comfort's
online boutique and also enjoys the blog Laws of General

lightly worn items that they're finished with and
people buy them." Though she's never purchased any
thing from the unique blog site, she finds it to be -enter

Schepp, Petunia's Folly and Head Start Shoes. She mixes

their high quality, investment items with morc
items from Uniqlo, Gap and Club Monaco.
Buurma loves designers like Comme des
(especially Junya Watanabe's designs), Rachel Comey and
Jil Sander for Uniqlo.

Inspirations / Influences:

\

uurma loved her grandmoth- \
er's elegant style and tries to emu- \
late some of that same elegance in \
\
her style. But she described her
inspiration as a "high-low mixing of \
styles" that stems from her developing her own style during the 90s. "In
which is
the early and mid-90s
when I was in high school thinking
really for the first time about personal
style
clothes (for me at least) were all
about music, grunge and gothic industrial," Buurma said in an e-mail. I
remember the part of that I liked the
a
most was 'deconstructed' tailoring
style that in its essence is very like the
dress with combat boots."

While developing her style, Buurma
began teaching at age 23 and had to figure
out how to distinguish herself from her
similarly-aged students. "I would wear a
suit partly because it felt like it gave me
authority and partly so people could literally tell who the professor was," she said.
Buurma explores the boundaries of a professor. "There are very few actual restrictions
on what I can wear," Buurma said. Buurma
has found that her regular style is meshed
with her professorial look, which has
allowed for more continuity in her style.

David Fincher
("The Curious Case of
Benjamin Button") use the two lawsuits to
organize the narrative arc of the story that
gradually reveals Zuckerberg's character.
The lawsuit filed by Cameron and Tyler
Winklevoss (both played by Armie
Hammer) and Divya Narenda (Max
Minghella) claims that the idea behind
Facebook was stolen from the Harvard
Connection site that the twins and

jealousy and impatience led
Zuckerberg to ultimately
reject his only real social con-

nection for the sake of
Facebook. Zuckerberg, perhaps jealous of Saverin's
acceptance into the exclusive

Phoenix S-K final club, leads
Saverin into investing money
in Facebook, cutting him off just before
the company takes off and becomes a billion-dollar corporation. Zuckerberg also
comes into contact with Sean Parker
(Justin Timberlake), Napster co-founder.
The film is framed by Zuckerberg's
interactions with Erica; these encounters
demonstrate the woes of Zuckerberg's
social life that influence his attempt to

one coherent series of events that seem to
chronologically record the events that led
to the creation of Facebook; this innovative structure is the strongest feature of
the film, showing how filmmakers can
manipulate time to establish dramatic
structures and give character insights.
By utilizing motifs of social acceptance
and demonstrating Zuckerberg's lack of

social competence, the film creates a sinis-

ter and even condescending tone. The film

suggests that Facebook's creation is the
result of a quest for revenge toward the

Zuckerberg.
Despite an innovative narrative structure, "The Social Network" lacks originality. The film is nothing more than another
biopic aimed to make problematic a
genius's claim to fame. In fact, the film is

much like "Pirates of Silicon Valley,"
wherein Bill Gates (Anthony Michael
Hall) steals the idea for a graphics-based
operating system for personal computers,
"Windows," from Steve Jobs (Noah Wyle).
In "Pirates of Silicon Valley," muchlike in

"The Social Network," Gates, a Harvard
undergraduate, takes an idea and launches his own version first to gain unreasonable fame and riches, estranging his best
friend and business partner along the way.
This appalling similarity is possibly even
alluded to in the film; in one scene, Bill
Gates gives a talk at Harvard and looks at
Zuckerberg when he says the next Bill
Gates could be in this room.
More likely, the film is indicative of a
troubling narrative formula most biopics
follow: the genius innovator gains much
success, the success gets to him, and as a
result, the genius alienates friends and
loved ones. This biopic formula has
become repetitive and boring. For a movie
like "The Social Network," its merits are
marred by a genre that refuses to update.

"The Social Network" is a biopic of
Mark Zuckerberg and how the creation of
Facebook was ironically a product of the
social woes he faced in real life. The film,
an adaptation of Ben Mezrick's "The
Accidental Billionaires," frames the creation of Facebook between the depictions
of two important lawsuits filed against

control society through a social networking site. His break-up with his girlfriend,
the opening scene, leads him to create the
"facemash" site, where he uses pictures
amassed from the Harvard houses' "face
book" directories to make a "Hot or Not"
game, which impresses the Winklevoss
twins and Narenda enough to give
Zuckerberg the opportunity to work on
their Harvard Connection site. The ending
scene, in which he awaits the result of a
friend request to Erica, demonstrates that
even with his success in innovating the
social lives of many, he still fails to have
any sort of meaningful social interaction.

Can the Yes Men change the world?
BY QUITTERIE GOUNOT
qgounotl@swarthmore.edu
How do you get a common American citizen to sign
a petition whose stated purpose is to increase global
warming, leading to a new ice age? Just ask the Yes
Men, which is comprised of activisits Andy Bichlbaum
and Mike Bonanno, who undertook this peculiar project and managed to convince a surprising number of
people of the benefits of government policy favoring
global warming. Bichlbaum and Bonanno sought to
expose, through exaggeration, what they saw as major
flaws in environmental policy under the Bush regime.
The Yes Men will be presenting this popular albeit controversial form of activism during their visit to
Swarthmore today.
As their aliases Jacques Servin and Igor Vamos,
Bichlbaum and Bonnano devise and enact a series of
elaborate pranks with particular political messages.
According to their website, their mission is "identity
correction," that is, "impersonating big-time criminals
in order to publicly humiliate them." Those whom they
believe to be most in need of this kind ofcorrection are
"leaders and big corporations who put profits ahead of
everything else." The name "Yes Men" comes from the
concept of manipulating ideas one might seem to agree
with on the surface in such a way
as to make its negative, deep<
implications apparent.
A number of the college's

departments and professors,

ful and interesting," Mee said. Mee had used the Yes
Men's work in several classes she taught in the past and
this semester, she incorporated the Yes Men in two of
her courses as the duo uses theatrics to promote social
change.

The Yes Men's relevance to the Swarthmore academic scene ranges far beyond just theater. The Yes Men
incorporate political and social issues into their acts,
which include issues of corporate greed and abuses of
power. Their acts also resound with professors in the
Art History department.
"I have assigned the [Yes Men] lecture to all of my
classes, but the students in my honors seminar on
avant-garde practice in the 20th Century have been
asked to consider how these events, and the Yes Men's
practice in general, might be considered avant-garde"
Art History professor Janine Mileaf said. "I'm asking
them to put these 'pranks' into an historical context,
and look for precedents for this kind of engagement
with the social sphere."
While the Yes Men's style of activism certainly has
its fans, it is also controversial. The Yes Men claim to
"tell little lies to get at bigger truths." Whatever their
ends, some would insist, they still use
dishonesty and deception as some of
t their main tools. For the Yes Men
fe and their supporters, however, their
ends and the perceived lack of
morality of the people they target
clearly justify the means the Yes

Men use to criticize such people's
Dehavior.
"I think they push the edge of
what is acceptable behavior.
And I think that art has done
that for a long time. From
my point of view,
their practice stays

such Associate Professor of
Theater Erin Mee, joined
forces to bring the Yes Men
to campus as part of the
Cooper Series. "I love
their work. I think
it's very power-

on this side of responsible because it tar- il
gets
institutions, 1
rather than individu-W
als," Mileaf said. "But
am sympathetic to those 1
who disagree. I think that
one positive result of the
Yes Men's presence on
_
campus could be to ignite conver
sations about just where each one of us
draws that line."
Blaine O'Neill 11 worked with the Yes Men in
Copenhagen last year during the U.N. negotiations on
climate change along with Zach Postone 'IL O'Neill
hopes that the issues addressed in the lecture and workshop will resonate with students. "We're focusing on a
specific project and I'm hoping this action will catalyze
a longer term Yes Man-style collaboration at
Swarthmore," O'Neill said.
The Yes Men's visit to Swarthmore has two parts: a
public lecture and performance at 4:15 p.m. today, in
the LPAC cinema, and a workshop tomorrow from 2:00
to 5:00 p.m. in the Frear Ensemble Theatre. During the
lecture and performance portion, the Yes Men will
explain what they do and share some of their work,
focusing on their most recent pieces. During the workshop, they will gather with a particular group of students to develop a concrete activist approach to an
issue of concern, mountain top removal, which is the
process through which the top of mountains are blown
off by coal companies.
"In their actions, the Yes Men address some of the

most pressing issues of our times—global warming and
corporate culture to name a few. I don't think you need
to be an artist to appreciate that they are trying to
bring awareness to structures of power in our society,"

Mileaf said.

Unsigned artist releases new exploratory album
BY JOHN OH
johl@swarthmore.edu

Unknown Component is a one-man
band created by Keith Lynch, a multi-talented musician from lowa City, lowa. He
began this project in 2002 as a means to
express himself through words and music.
He is currently an unsigned artist who has
seven albums released and two more on
their way. As an entirely self-taught musician, he plays the guitar, bass, drums and
piano in the songs on the past seven
albums.
"I never got into musical education or
instruction, and I still can't read music, but
pure music isn't based upon that," Lynch
said. "One day I found an acoustic guitar in
the attic, and then after a year or two, I was
writing original music. It was more enjoyable for me to write original music than
play music written by others."
Lynch artfully crafts each of the different instruments to produce a unique
indie/pop/rock blend, which also holds
true for his newest album "The Infinite

Definitive."

"The Infinite Definitive" as a whole is
heavy with very personal experiences that
are embedded in the lyrics of the songs. His
opening track, "Moving Out of Frame,"
and his final track, "Electric Dissolution,"
are especially packed with emotion. In
some ways, the album is so personal that

THEPHOENIX

much ofthe content is difficult for the audience to relate to. Part of this disconnect has
to do with the enigmatic word choices he
uses, making the interpretation of the
songs broad.
For example, the lyrics of "Every
Measure of Space" go: "In the remainder of
a few/an illustration of the used/and if the

actors take their cues/the conversations
will ensue between the frozen forms of
force and levitations of remorse/the com-

plications from the source speak ofmandatory wars." It's difficult to make any kind
of interpretation of the lyrics to relate to
oneself. However, the broadness keeps the
audience curious and attentive to the
songs.

"Writing music and lyrics are separate
processes. When writing music, it's not
cognitive but purely emotion," Lynch said
of his writing process. "When writing
lyrics, I have a stream of consciousness
where nothing is completely concrete."
One of the First things you notice about
this album is the uniqueness of Lynch's
voice. He has a husky voice that sounds
purposefully strained in the upper register.
The sound also projects through the nose,
which really works for some of the songs.
Although the voice is similar in almost all
of the songs, it gives the album character.
Almost the entire album has a great
blend of instrumentation that is easy on
the ears, showing how passionate and tal-

ented the artist is; however, it is difficult
for the audience to be as engaged as the
artist himself.
In most of the songs, the audience ends
up being passive listeners, occasionally
feeling the need to tap its feet to the more
upbeat songs. This may have to do with the
fact that the album has little variation. The
intro to every song is well put together and
refreshing, but after the introduction, the
chorus and the verses of the songs seem
very parallel to each other.
The components of great music are all
within the album. There are definitely
moments when the music comes to life, but
there are also parts that ignore the crucial
connection between the artist and the audience. For example, his fifth track, "The
Experience of Understanding," has a piano
part that really solidifies the melody and

brings the music together, while the guitars play an eerie counter melody.
However, the music sounds almost too
rehearsed. Music, at its finest, should feel
like it is being played for the first time,
regardless of how many times it has been
practiced. The feeling of spontaneity just
isn't here. A possible reason for the lack of
spontaneity could be because the band consists of only one man. It could be that there
is so much going on for one person that his
mind is simply focused on playing versus

reaching out to the audience. That being
said, there is a great deal of credit to be

given to the artist for being able to pull off
such a great blend as a single person.
Overall, the album sounds raw, like a
couple more steps of polishing could be
used. But with time, improvements to his
work are definitely foreseeable.
"My inspiration comes from trying to
understand the bigger picture, to question
things that are difficult to understand and
can be looked at from different perspectives," Lynch said ofhis source of inspiration for his music.
"The Infinite Definitive" is scheduled to
be released on Oct. 12, 2010.

Gay teen suicides show we have not made progress
While standing at the helm of the 21st century may
make us feel progressive, we still have a great deal of work
to do when it comes to equal rights and respect.
Take, for instance, Tyler Clementi, a Rutgers University
student who killed himself last month after his roommate
allegedly broadcast a sexual encounter Clementi had with
another man in their dorm room on the Internet.
Clementi is one of several LGBTQ teenagers who have
committed suicide in recent weeks after their peers purportedly harassed them.
While these stories have begun catching the public's
attention, antagonism toward and suicide among gay
teenagers are not new issues.
About 85 percent of LGBTQ teenagers say they suffer
harassment in high school, according to a 2009 Gay Lesbian
Straight Education Network survey. Lesbian, gay and
bisexual young adults are four times more likely to attempt
suicide than peers who are heterosexual, according to the
Massachusetts 2007 Youth Risk Survey. And of all
American teenagers who commit suicide, 30 percent are
LGBTQ. (That said, suicide is the second highest cause of
death among college students.)
So if harassment and teenage suicide are not new
issues, what do these recent incidents illuminate? For one,

we can no longer buy into an oft-claimed myth that discrimination surfaces only in localized, "unenlightened," or
'expected" places
these instances ofharassment and suicide were all across the country.
As dementi's suicide and the seeming harassment that
prompted it happened at a university, we should also
remind ourselves that college students are not immune to
bigotry. And we cannot ignore the fact that these problems

may even arise at Swarthmore.
In 2008, for instance, there were claims that attendees al
the Genderfuck party displayed homophobic attitudes,

from verbal insults to physical aggression to derisive costumes. Clearly, this alleged environment was contrary tc
the party's focus on safe, liberating gender-bending. But we
can glean a much more sobering thought: discrimination
and bigotry exists here,

pending appeal.
Our legal system's inaction and conservatism in
regards to gay rights mirrors the country's unwillingness
to embrace equality; in turn, this inaction only encourages

discrimination.
After all, how can children and teenagers, ever-impressionable, learn to accept LGBTQ members if they live in a

It seems that the economic recession

J|l J|_ °f a summer day on
Walnut Street, I'm walking down the street, discovering the city. Men, women, kids, different people from different backgrounds are all passing by with the same
motivation in their minds: shopping.
I enter the Apple store with the
money that I have been saving for some
time now, planning to buy a Macßook
with the college student discount. I have
been to many stores in my life, been
through big discounts, but never seen
such a demand. People were buying laptops, iPods
sometimes both of them at
the same time. I was shocked, and a bit
annoyed by the fact that it took me 20
minutes to get some kind of assistance,
and one hour to buy the actual laptop.
This incident led me to think how
electronics are so popular in the U.S.
Because most of these goods are imported to Turkey, my home country, they are
much more expensive there. But still it
was quite interesting to see in a country
where two of the three articles in the
newspaper are about the recession, people are so eager to buy a laptop or a
Magic Mouse.
It struck me how trends or tastes can

money that they may not even have. We

current trend.

THE PHOENIX

I feel it has to do with our modernized
and electronic lifestyle too. We have
computers,
iPhones,
iPads, palm
Blackberries and many other derivatives, and we circle our lives around this
technology. Our professors post assignments online, our friends post pictures
online, we learn our application decisions through e-mail. That is how our
lives turned out to be, addicted to the
Internet and technology.
In the past it would be voluntary to do
a task online or by hand. Day by day, we
become more technology-dependent and
feel the need to fill our free time with
various electronic things. The day when
a new cellphone arrives at the shelves,
we camp in front of the stores, patiently
wait for the stores to open. That is how
addicted we, as the new generation, have
become to the technology. Be it a PSP,
iPhone, or any other new gadget that has
just come out, we all have some kind of
variation of a technological device and
depend on it for our daily lives.
On another note, I must clarify that I
am not an enemy of technology, and
quite enjoy my own gadgets myself. All
I'm trying to do is point out some of my
observations that are much different in
the US than where I come from. Be it the
price of the imported products in
Turkey, or peoples' reservations against
technology, there is less of a technology
love where I'm coming than here in the
States.
And it is a good thing in theory, having information at your fingertips,
reaching someone in a second, getting
the course material on the Internet, but
is that how we want our life to be? Don't
we want to be unreachable sometimes?
Do you ever miss waiting for the letter to
come?
Have you ever had a pen pal? Waiting
for the letter to arrive, finally receiving

it, reading the hand-written letter, and
writing a reply must have been one of
the most enjoyable cycles for pen pals in
the past. Today, we call, text, e-mail, send
Facebook and Blackberry messages. It
takes at most a second for what we have
to say to arrive at the other party's
hands. How satisfactory is this really?
And what is next? Teleporting, travelling
from one place to another in less than a

second? I will not be surprised when that
happens.
The famous physicist Albert Einstein
once said, "It has become appallingly
obvious that our technology has exceeded our humanity." He said that over 50
years ago, and look at us now. Where is
our technology relative to our humanity? And most importantly, where is it
going to be in another 50 years?

an attempt to repair government
finances. (Although the Great Recession
is officially over, according to an absurd
definition based on figures of economic
growth rather than unemployment figures, it clearly still affects millions of
people even here in the city of London
alone.)

Private jobs, however, are being cut
too, and European workers in the private sector are no less keen to strike
than those working for the government.
As you may have experienced yourself if
you have flown to Europe recently,
British Airways cabin personnel have
been on strikes repeatedly for months
now in a bid to avoid layoffs.
I applaud the efforts of workers who
try to improve their working conditions
or avoid unnecessary layoffs. In fact, I
think workers in the United States
should strike more often to make them
selves heard. Yet there is an even better
option than frequent striking, which is
especially strong in Germany and in The
:

Netherlands. In these two countries
workers
sit
represented by unions
on a body together with government and
environmental leaders and representatives of business interests to jointly
address societal conflicts. For instance,
while in France workers were on strike
again to protest against an increase in
the retirement age from 60 to 62, union
and business representatives in The
Netherlands cut a deal that will gradually increase the minimumretirement age
from 65 to 67 over a period of ten years.
While the Dutch government was indecisive on the issue, employees and
employers cut a deal that mitigates the
pain for everyone involved, without the
need to strike and inconvenience travelers.
On the whole, workers in the US are
much more vulnerable than their
Western European counterparts. When
an American worker loses his job, he's
likely to also lose his health insurance
with it. American workers get nowhere
near the paid vacation days that
European workers get and can get fired
more easily. In addition, American
workers find it much more difficult to
unionize and have their say
either
through strikes or by sitting at the table
with business and government representatives. I'm not sure why it's more difficult for American workers, but the
prospect of getting fired and losing one's
job can't help.
Of course I have painted an idyllic
picture of the cooperation between various interest groups in The Netherlands
and Germany and conflicts aren't
always resolved quite so easily, even in
countries whose populations are much
more homogeneous than the population
of the United States. Many Western
European societies are deeply divided
over issues of immigration, justice and
the question of how to progress with

Emma Waitzman for The Phoenix

integration within the European Union.
And of course in Germany and The
Netherlands, too, there are those who
want the minimum retirement age
untouched and will go on strike to
emphasize their point. On most economic matters, however, the German and
Dutch models encourage consensusbuilding rather than resolving conflicts
through voting and thereby dividing the
population.
Despite larger differences in culture
and political views within the United

States, American workers could be
empowered by formalizing their place at
discussion tables and not just through
voting for representatives in government.

To start with, unions should be given
more power
an unlikely change, I
grant you, especially in the current

political climate. Still I think unions
must be given a greater say in an insti-

tution such as the National Economic
Council, which reports directly to the

president.

It's easy to dismiss the point that
workers should have more rights as
socialist for, after all, the theory of
socialism is based in part on the distinction between workers and capitalists.
Socialism, obviously, is a dirty word in
American politics because of its negative connotations.
But what is there to say against giving the vast majority of Americans, who
are employees at a company they do not
own, more power to negotiate better
working conditions? In this respect,
European workers must be envied.

Immigration crucial to advancement of U.S. economy
BY VIJAI NARAYANAN

TECHNIQUE,
SEPT. 23, 2010

Over the course of history,
the United States has attracted
the most brilliant and talented
minds from across the globe,
offering them the prospect of a
better life and a chance to start
over. The American Dream, a
belief that through hard work
and determination, any immigrant can earn a better life for
his family and for posterity, has
long been a part of American
culture and tradition. A few
weeks ago I, decided to become a
naturalized citizen. As I filled

out the application to begin the
process, I felt fortunate to have
been offered the extraordinary
opportunity.
However, in the weeks that
have passed since I completed
my application, Arizona has

zenship and a lunatic tried to
hold a Quran burning. The U.S.
is by far the most accepting
nation of immigrants in the
world, but I can't help but wonder what the recent rise in
nativism and xenophobia mean
for America's future in the 21st

century.

Immigration is a complex
issue and has had a tumultuous
past in American history.
Without a doubt, the immigration system today is broken and
in desperate need of repair. The
current system does little to
identify and recruit highly
skilled labor, -allows multinational companies to abuse the
process of obtaining visas for
their employees and does little to
retain talented immigrants educated in the U.S. The issue of illegal immigration compounds the
problem several fold.
The problems with legal
immigration in the U.S. are
arguably the most urgent to
solve. They are also easily solvable. The process by which
employment visas are distributed needs to be more flexible

and account for the economic
realities of our nation. The current yearly cap for employment
visas is set around 700,000 per
year, a figure that hasn't
changed since 1990. The cap for

skilled workers in the U.S.
should be based on research and
data about labor market trends
and shortages that are prevalent
in the U.S. economy.
Another prevalent issue
regarding immigration includes
the challenge of retaining immigrants who earn an education in
the U.S., particularly those who
earn advanced degrees. These
students generally represent the
best that their country has to
offer, and they contribute significantly to American society.
According to the Wall Street
Journal, over 50 percent of
Silicon Valley start-ups in the
past decade were created by
immigrants.
Increasingly, however, students earning advanced degrees
in the U.S. are choosing to
return to their home countries,
primarily because of the longevity and uncertainty of the immi-

October 7, 2010

gration process. These individuals should be put on a fast track
to gaining permanent residency.
Illegal immigration is a complex, multi-faceted problem that
must be dealt with carefully.
There are currently approximately 11 million illegal immigrants in the U.S., who make up
a vital part of the American
economy by fulfilling roles that
are either undesired or unwanted by other segments of the population.

The idea to round up and
deport every illegal immigrant
is impractical. The U.S. cannot
afford the cost of carrying out
such a procedure, especially in
such economic times.
Furthermore, it would rip
apart immigrant families who
have staked their livelihoods
and their children's future in the
U.S. Illegal immigrants must be
provided a path to legalization,
whereby they recognize the
crime of having entered the U.S.
illegally, pay back taxes and
agree to enter the naturalization
process, same as any legal immigrant.

The issue of protecting our
borders and enforcing the law
must also be tackled. The Border
Patrol is seriously understaffed
and lacks the resources to pre-

vent

illegal

crossings.

An

increased presence along key
areas on the border is necessary
to deter crossings. In addition,
employers who offer jobs to illegal immigrants must be punished.
It is my hope that the recent
surge in nativism and xenophobia are nothing more than
results of election year tactics
employed by politicians to get reelected. One thing is certain,
must
however—immigration
continue to play an important

role

in

America's progress.

Immigration reform is necessary if the U.S. hopes to remain a
leader in the 21st century. In the
meantime, I'll be waiting anxiously for a call from USCIS
about the status of my applica-

tion.

Field hockey picks up impressive victory vs. Arcadia
BY VICTOR BRADY AND ANA APOSTOLERIS
vbradyX aapostol@swarthmore.edu

The Swarthmore Garnet field hockey team broke a two game losing
streak with a dominating performance
on Wednesday, defeating the visiting
Arcadia Knights 3-2."
A swarming and aggressive Garnet
defense limited the Knights to only
seven shots, four on goal, while the
Swarthmore offense pounded a pair of
Arcadia goaltenders with 17 shots, 12
of which were on goal.
Goals by forward Nia Jones 'l4,
the versatile Catie Meador 'l3, who
plays forward, back and midfield for
Swarthmore, and midfielder Sophia
Agathis 'l3 highlighted the Garnet's
fourth win of the season, as the team
improved to 4-6 overall.
Wednesday's matchup marked a
break in the Garnet's Centennial
Conference schedule. Having dropped
two consecutive Centennial games, to
Johns Hopkins and Washington, after
a victory over Bryn Mawr, the Garnet
came out firing against the Knights.
Arcadia came into Wednesday's
game with seven wins on the season,
but Swarthmore earned a penalty corner just over two minutes into the
game. Katie Teleky 'l3 nearly put the
Garnet out in front, firing a shot just
wide of the Arcadia goal on a loose
ball in the circle.
The Garnet continued to pressure
before finally breaking through just
after the 18 minute mark, when Sophia
Ferguson 'll crossed a deflected shot
to Jones off the team's sixth corner.
For Jones, it was the fifth goal of
her impressive first-year campaign.
Just over four minutes later, the
Garnet offense swarmed the Knights
circle again, forcing the ball down low
towards Arcadia keeper Marissa
Perez. Perez fell on top of the ball, giving the Garnet a penalty stroke.
For the second consecutive game,
Swarthmore called on Meador to score
on the stroke, and for the second consecutive game, she found the back of
the cage.
Meador's goal gave the Garnet a 2-0
lead, but Arcadia cut the Swarthmore
lead in half late in the first 35 minute

session.

After halftime, Swarthmore continued to control play, taking nine penalty corners after halftime to Arcadia's

two.

The Garnet finally broke through
for its third goal of the game thanks to
the fabulous individual effort from
Agathis, who dribbled through the
entire Arcadia defense and into the
circle before ripping a low drive into
the goal to make the score 3-L
The goal was the eighth of Agathis'
collegiate career. The sophomore now
has 30 career points.
Arcadia responded again late in the
half to make it a one goal game with
six minutes to play. But Swarthmore
held tight for the victory.
Wednesday's game was the first in
over a week for the field hockey team.
The team had previously taken the
field last Tuesday at Washington
College and took advantage of the full
week off to improve conditioning and
communication.
That improvement showed as
Swarthmore out-hustled Arcadia
throughout Wednesday's game, consistently pinning the Knights deep
within their own half for extended
periods of play.

season,

Giants in playoffs on back of Huff's rhinestone thong

ticipate in
them. And, in true Giants style, it took
until the last game of the season to
make it happen.
But as I bask in the glory of finally
making it out of the regular season,
the question lingers of how exactly we
got here. What makes this season different from the past six? If you ask
Aubrey Huff, it's all because of a red,
rhinestone-studded "Rally Thong."
Yes, he does mean a pair of women's
underwear. Huff donned this particular pair of underwear on August 31,
before the Giants' last 30 games of the
regular season, and claimed, "Here's
20 wins right here." Although most
people at the time dismissed this as
just another illustration of Huff's
eccentric personality, with this weekend's win against the Padres, the
Giants' record since the thong-incident is 20-10. His prediction actually
came true. Now he is predicting,
"We're going to sell more of these than
Panda hats [head gear brought out last
season in support of fan favorite Giant

Pablo Sandavol]." Who knew underwear could ever be so important in
professional baseball?
While'l don't want to stop any baseball fans from investing in the thong
industry to help their favorite team
out Huff-style, I think there might be
more to the Giants' surge to the top of
the NL West than, underwear. The
truth is that at the upper echelons of
athletic competition, the difference
between being in the playoffs and
watching them from home can come
down to the very last game of the season. So what is the final determining
factor that, for example, puts the
Giants into the playoffs and leaves the
Padres picking up the shambles of
their season?
Taking into account the number of
World Series wins for the New York
Yankees and the size of their payroll,
many assume that the richer the team
the more success they will have. In
fact, the MLB set up a blue-ribbon
panel in 1999 to look into payroll
inequities,
to Jerry
according
Harbour's book The Performance
Paradox. The panel's reports found
that there were payroll inequities in
baseball, and these inequities were
correlated with a team's ability to win.
Yet the story is more complicated
than that. When a few economics professors took on the panel's findings in
The Wages of Wins, the expanded sample size of their study showed that contrary to the panel's report, there was
no evidence for a link between payroll
size and World Series titles. In fact,
Harbour points out, in the 2007 playoffs, the Yankees ($216 million payroll)

lost to the Indians ($70.5 million), the
Phillies ($100.6 million) lost to the
Rockies ($60.6 million) and the Cubs
lost
the
($113.5
million)
to
Diamondbacks ($69.8 million).
So money cannot buy you a championship. However, investing in your
brain might be able to. Yogi Berra's
saying, "Ninety percent of this game is
half mental," might be truer than even
he knew. In a study of Canadian
Olympic Athletes, researchers Terry
Orlick and John Partington found that
but of mental, physical and technical
readiness factors, only mental readiness showed a statistically significant
correlation with Olympic ranking. Of
the over 200 Olympic athletes asked,
only three percent categorized their
focus as "very effective" during competition while 60 percent categorized
it as "ineffective." These results led
the researchers to conclude that many
Olympians were not performing up to
potential due to lack of preparation in
dealing with the distractions associated with high-level competitions.
These results have been supported
by studies done on paradoxical performance effects, better known as
choking under pressure. In a review of
recent literature on these effects in the
European
Journal
of Social
Psychology, Roy Baumeister and
Carolin Showers outline the possible
models that explain why some athletes
choke under pressure. All of these
models approach the problem as arising from self-awareness and are essentially a not-to-do list for teams as they
enter the postseason. So here is a bit of
what the research has shown and

what it could mean for the Giants
L Performance-contingent awards
can cause players to imagine they
have already won the award and
therefore choke. This may explain
why, entering a three game series
against the Padres at home, the Giants
almost got swept and thus forced into
a three-way tiebreaker to get into the
playoffs at all. Take it one day at a
time, guys; you haven't won anything
yet.
2. Players can get distracted by
worry and fear of failing. Well, Bay
Area teams at this point have been so
good at failing in the playoffs that I
have to imagine they have learned to
deal with that fear by now.
3. Under pressure, players stop executing their performances automatically and instead begin to consciously
control their actions, leading to a
decrease in effectiveness. This suggests that the Giants need to stop
thinking and just play. If only there
were a catchy Nike slogan that could
help them remember this ...
If the mental side of sports is really
what it takes to win a championship,
then I feel pretty good about the
Giants'. chances. While this team
might have a great pitching staff or
might have a deep bench, the one
thing the players have proven for sure
is that they will do anything to win. So
ignore what everyone else says, Huff,
and you go ahead and wear your red
rhinestone Rally Thong. As long as
you have the World Series ring to

Despite tie, men's soccer climbs in NSCAA poll

swarthmorephoenix.com

BY VICTOR BRADY
vbradyl@swarthmore.edu
Ranked No. 2 in the D3soccer.com
national poll, the Swarthmore men's
soccer team entered Saturday's
Centennial Conference match at
Gettysburg with a target squarely on
its back.
The Bullets came out firing on their
homecoming weekend, knocking the
Garnet on its heels and forcing a 1-1
draw, the first game this season in
which Swarthmore did not come away
victorious. With the tie, Swarthmore is
now 9-0-1 on the season and 3-0-1 in
Centennial Conference play. The
Garnet is tied atop the Centennial
standings with rival Haverford.
Despite the draw, the Garnet maintained its rank in the D3soccer.com
poll and moved up one spot in the
National Soccer Coaches Association
of America (NSCAA) poll from No. 3 to
No. 2.
Swarthmore has struggled against
Gettysburg since the formation of the
Centennial Conference. Since the
teams first met in conference play in
1993, Swarthmore is just 3-14-1 vs. the
Bullets. The three wins are the fewest
by Swarthmore versus any Centennial
opponent since the Conference's inception.
As teams around the Centennial
Conference struggle with the potent
Swarthmore offense and strangling
defense, Gettysburg attacked the
Garnet for the second year in a row.

evening with fog blanketing Clothier

The tie did not result in a drop in

was not satisfied with the result.
"Saturday was a wake-up call, and it
came at a fortuitous time. We had just
experienced a disappointing performance on Wednesday at Washington

Saturday we learned that we cannot

Reichert added.
Wagner believes that the team and

Volleyball victorious in "Digging for a Cure" match
BY RENEE FLORES

rfloresl@swarthmore.edu

The Swarthmore Garnet volleyball
team defeated McDaniel College in
straight sets on Saturday to improve to
12-4 on the season, 2-1 in the Centennial
Conference. Play was fierce in this
Centennial match with more at stake
than just conference standings.
During October, five Centennial contests, featuring 10 of the conference's 11

teams, are part of the Centennial's fifth
annual "Digging for a Cure" campaign to
fight breast cancer, and Saturday's game
was the Garnet's "Digging for a Cure"
match.
Prior to designated "Digging for a
Cure" matches, every Conference school
collects donations and pledges for each
dig that the team records in a match. A
dig, according to the Centennial
Conference website, is a defensive play
where a player prevents an opponent
from scoring by "digging" the ball before
it hits the ground.
For the fourth consecutive year, the
money raised will go to Living Beyond
Breast Cancer (LBBC), a local organization based in Haverford. The mission
statement ofLBBC is "[to] empower all
women affected by breast cancer to live
as long as possible with the best quality
of life."
Just last year, the Centennial teams
raised over $10,680, and over the four
years of the initiative, the teams have
raised over $36,000.
The Swarthmore defense was strong
on Saturday, recording a total of 54 digs
in the match, with libero Hillary
Santana 'l2 leading the team with 14.
Senior captain Sarah Lambert and
Danielle Sullivan 'l4 recorded seven
digs each.
Maggie Duszyk 'l3 led the team with
five block assists.
Offense did not lack on Saturday
either as the Garnet attack recorded 42
kills.
Kat
Montemurro 'l3
led
Swarthmore with 16 kills while Genny
Pezzola 'l2 added nine.
After dominating the first two sets 258, 25-11, McDaniel responded with fury
in the third. The Green Terror led the
third set 21-19 before Swarthmore closed
on a 6-1 run to win the third set 25-22.

The loss dropped McDaniel to 1-2 in
Centennial play.
The players were pleased to record
the victory, their second consecutive in
Centennial play after dropping the conference-opening
match to Johns
Hopkins. But they were also honored to
have the opportunity to contribute to
LBBC. "I think [LBBC] is special [in
that] it's a local organization. A lot of
schools participate in national fundraisers, but national is more anonymous,"
Lisa Shang 'l2 said.
Duszyk agreed, stating that using
sports to get donations for a cause leads
to a lot of publicity for issues of great
importance to many people.
Even with the added importance of
the contest, the Garnet recognizes that
there is still room for significant
improvement in team play. "We don't
have a game yet in which we played our
best. Our schedule only gets harder,
[and we will be playing] very good
teams," Shang said.
Swarthmore has yet to play Franklin
and Marshall, Haverford or Gettysburg,
three of the top five teams in the
Centennial standings and the three
teams that joined Swarthmore in the
conference semifinals last year.
"It's a relief to know that we can win
even though [we haven't always played
our best]," said Duszyk, who has seen
the team mix strong performances'with
those she calls "less pretty." But the
Garnet has shown the ability to
rebound, ready to play competitively
and respond to opponents' runs.
"We need to have the mindset ofending that first set early and not letting
opponents back in the game," Shang
said, commenting on McDaniel's third
set performance. "I think the general
attitude [of the team] is that there's
always room to improve."
The Garnet looks to extend its winning streak tonight when it returns to
action against Centennial Conference
rival Bryn Mawr College. Action from
Tarble Pavilion is scheduled to begin at
7 p.m.
The team begins fall break play at
Dickinson Saturday and then takes on
Muhlenberg in a home game on Tuesday
before a trip to California for the CalLutheran Fall Classic next weekend.

Garnet women tied for first in Centennial Conference

BY VICTOR BRADY

The Swarthmore College women's
soccer team began the 2009 season on a
five game winning streak.
It took nearly a month longer for the
2010 team to earn its first winning
streak of the year. But the Garnet put
on a show Saturday, defeating
McDaniel by a score of 4-0 and earning
back-to-back victories for the first time
this year.
After struggling through injuries
and a brutal stretch of schedule in the
first month of 2010, the team improved
to 4-4-2 on the season, 3-1 in Centennial
Conference play with Saturday's win.
The 3-1 record ties Swarthmore for
first in the Centennial with Johns
Hopkins, Dickinson and Gettysburg.
The Garnet has lost to Hopkins, defeated Dickinson and has not faced
Gettysburg this year.
Saturday was a day of milestones for
the women's team as it equaled its highest goal-scoring output of the season.
Megan Colombo 'll opened the scoring in the 20th minute, taking a
through-ball from Hannah Purkey 'l4
and burying it in the back of the net for
her 25th career goal ar d her third of the
season.
Less than two minutes later, Amber
Famiglietti 'l4 scored her first collegiate goal, lobbing a perfectly placed
shot under the crossbar and over the
head ofMcDaniel's keeper Jan Woolley.
The teams entered halftime with the
score 2-0, but the Garnet put the game
away with two more goals in the middle
of the second half. Aly Passanante 'l4
scored her third goal of the season in
the 64th minute off a header on an
Elizabeth Mills 'll cross.

"As a defensive unit, you have to get
to a place where you instinctively know
the movements and tendencies of your
fellow defenders," Bolger said.
Bolger added, "This rhythm can take
time to find and with each game, we are
improving the cohesiveness of our play.
I would attest our recent shutouts to
better understanding the way in which
—

[our teammates] play."

Anckaitis believes that a change in
defending-perspective will allow the
defense to become more aggressive
throughout the rest of the season. "Our
perspective is hopefully shifting to
understand that regularly shutting out
the quality of competition that we've
played shouldn't be the expectation.
Because of this skewed perspective,
when we've given up goals, our decision making becomes tentativeand that
hasn't helped us ultimately do what we
do best and that is possess the ball."
The Garnet will look to extend its
winning streak to three games on
Saturday when it hosts Bryn Mawr.
Swarthmore has a fourteen game winning streak against the Owls.
Swarthmore continues its fall break
schedule on Tuesday as the Garnet
hosts Muhlenberg in a critical
Centennial matchup. The Mules are
currently 2-1 in Centennial play.
