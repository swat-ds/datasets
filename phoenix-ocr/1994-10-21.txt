members without the security of a
position. Advising and
instruction are improved when more
faculty members receive the commitment and distinction that tenure
provides.
Swarthmore College currently
employs 193faculty members for the
Fall '94 Semester. One hundred and
seven faculty members have received
tenure, and 44 members are on the
tenure track. The college employs 21
professors in a full-time non-tenuretrack capacity and another 21 professors in a part-time capacity, which is
equivalent to 7.3 full-time positions.
Thus, only 10.9% of the faculty consists of part-time positions, a figure
one-third of that indicated by AAUP
for all liberal arts colleges.
Provost JennieKeith said thatmany
temporary members are hired because
of the special opportunity to take
fourth-year sabbaticals that
Swarthmore provides to tenure-track
faculty. Keith said anywhere from
nine to twenty-one leave replacements may be necessary for a given
year.
permanent

On September 20, 1994, a TriCollege Professor sent an anonymous
letter to the editors of The Phoenix

and The Bi-College News expressing
fear thathis or her job security was in
jeopardy. Attached to the letter was
an article entitled "The Status ofNonTenure Track Faculty," which first
appeared in the July-August 1993
issue of Academe, the newsletter of
the AmericanAssociation ofUniversity Professors (AAUP). The unnamed professor believes that the
unusually high number of non-tenure-track positions places these faculty members at a disadvantage, as
detailed in the article.
The guidelines of the AAUP state
that a professor cannot be kept in a
full-time temporary position for
longer than seven years. After the
seventh year, the institution has to
make a commitment to him by "common law," and the professor may
remain with the institution permanently if hechooses. There are longterm part-time positions which do
not necessarily lead to tenure.
AAUP cites that at liberal arts col-

leges, part-time professors comprise
32.6% of the faculty and temporary

full-time professors 11.4%. AAUP
claims that the number of non-tenured positions undermines the quality of the education the institution
can offer. The increase in temporary
faculty weakens the influence of tenured faculty. As anotherconsequence,
the AAUP purports that the school's
academic freedom decreases with an
increase in the number of faculty

Non-tenure-track positions are also
needed in an academic institution
when students express interest in a
new field of study. Until the college
is certain that the interest in this special area will be continual, it will not
want to invest in a permanent position. Keith tries to hire temporary
faculty on contracts beyond one year

Student Council Hosts Open Meeting About Tarble
By Erik Huneke and Elizabeth Weber

On Wednesday, October 19 at 8:00 pm, the
Student Council held a meeting to discuss the
prices of food and the credit offered to students
at Tarble Snack Bar. The event was organized
by Lyndsley Wilkerson '97. Among the issues
raised was the elimination of the 25-cent surcharge placed on packaged items obtained under credit as of Thursday, October 20. The new
price system is possible due to a change in
vendors supplying the school with these products.

Larry Schall, Associate Vice-President for
Facilities and Services, Linda McDougall, Director of Dining Services, and Janet Kassab,
Cash Operations Manager for theFood Service
attended the meeting. Schall began by mentioning that the system of Tarble credit was
developed five years ago, when Swarthmore

depended on Morrison's food service to feed

Angela Davis Inaugurates SPAC/SASS Series
By Ben Salter
Angela Davis is the first of three speakers in
the "Critical Confrontations: A Critique of
Structural Inequality Within and Beyond the
Boundaries of Race and Class" series sponsored by the Socialist Political Action Collective (SPAC) and the Swarthmore AfricanAmerican Student Society (SASS). She will
speak on Friday, October 21 at 8 pm.
The series aims to examine the intersection
of the struggles of the working class with those
ofpeople faced with racial discrimination with
a particular focus on gender and sexuality.
Davis is a prominent left-wing political activist concerned with civil and labor rights. She
grew up in Birmingham, Alabama and was
active in the civil rights movement during the
1950'5. She also worked with the StudentNonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), the

Black Panthers, and the Communist Party,
which she joined in 1968. She taughtphilosophy at UCLA, and is currently a professor in
the History of Conscience program at the
University of California at Santa Cruz. Her
works include If They Come in the Morning:
Voices of Resistance, Women, Raceand Class,
and Women, Culture and Politics.
The speaker seriesis a scaled-downversion
of a larger Cooper Foundation proposal conceived by Michael Murphy '95 and Yonathan
Dessalegn '95. both members of SPAC, and
Keelyn Bradley '95, who was president of
SASS last year. The original proposal included 9 speakers, discussion panels with
students, and wouldhave culminated with the
publication of papers critiqued by the speakers. The Foundation rejected the idea for the
symposium as too broad and too expensive.
"The idea behind the series was an exami-

nation of the left, by the left," said Murphy. He
added thatcooperation between the two groups,
despite their political differences, was "a way
that SPAC and SASS could lend each other
support in achieving common goals, and to
form an alliance to confront the ideological
issues brought up by the Conservative Union.
We wanted to bring the labor movement and
the civil rights activists back together."
Dessalegn comments further that "we wanted
to build bridges betweenSPAC and SASS, and
look at these topics from an academic point of
view, and to inform the movement"
The other two speakers in the series will be
David Roedinger and Samuel Delany, but the
dates on which they will speak have not been
determinedyet. SPAC andSASS also intend to
bring in "lots of local organizers and political
activists" and hold a political symposium with
a branch of the AFL-CIO.

Before the existence of credit at Tarble,
Sharpies was open continuously through the
day. Schall noted that the "snack bar wasn't
built for" the 500 students who frequent it for
breakfast.Dominic Sagolla '96 advocatedabolishing breakfast at Tarble in order to extend the
hours during which it was offered at Sharpies to
provide a more comprehensive breakfast for
those who must consume itlater in the morning
or who live in off-campus dorms. In a referendum held in the past, however, the majority of
students reported to prefer Tarble due to such
factors as location and timing.
Even though all of the food at Tarble comes
from the dining hall, it costs more to feed
students at the snack bar. According to
Wilkerson, the College pays "something like
two cents for a cup of soda from a dispenser but
seventy-five cents for a bottle containing the

Campus Religious Groups
Revealed: A Student's Guide
By Tamar Charry
Religious organizations constitute
large part of the extracurricular
activities available to Swarthmore
students. While Swarthmore has officially been nonsectarian since its
split from the Religious Society of
Friends at the beginning of this century, various groups provide students
with opportunities to practice their
religious beliefs withinthe context of
the secularCollegeenvironment.The
following overview of some campus
groups is intended to highlight the
opportunities available to all students.
Caritas Christian Community
According to the 1994-95
Swarthmore Guide to Student Life,
"Caritas is a group of mostly Protestant students whose function is to
provide support to one another in
worship, questioning,and reflection."
This non-denominational organization practices and examines Protestant Christian religious beliefs.
The group is open to everyone.
According to the charter, "there is no
criteria for membership." It emphasizes that "all Caritas events, including the retreats, are open to all members of the college community, regardless of sex, race, color, age, religion, national origin, sexual preference, or handicap."
The group is directed by Pauline
Allen, Protestant Chaplain. It is an
informal group, says Betsy Geiger,
'96, who, together with together with
Elizabeth Armstrong, '96, acts as
steward for the group,.
The group holds organized meetings at 4 p.m. on Sundays in Bond. It
also organizes Credo, a program of
monthly presentations by members
of the Swarthmore faculty and staff
about issues relating to theirpersonal
faith. Meetings are held over dinner
in Sharpies.
In addition, "first Sunday programmed worship" provides a "more
formal" Protestant worship service,
says Geiger. It is held in the Friends'
Meetinghouse at 4 pm on the first
Sunday of each month. A mid-week
prayer session is also offered on
Wednesdays in Bond at 7 pm.
a

Ruach

The purpose of Ruach, according

Lisa Ginsburg '97, is
"toprovide a Jewish life oncampus."
As the only expressly Jewish organization on campus, she says, Ruach
organizes both religious and cultural
activities related to the Jewish community.
"Judaism is unique in that it's a
culture, but it's also a religion," says
Ginsburg. "There are a lot of people
who are more involved in the cultural
aspects thanthe religious ones." The
group is open to anyone whois interested.
Ruach hosts Shabbat (Sabbath)
services and a kosher vegetarian dinner every Friday night in Lodge 5.
They also organize an evening service for High Holiday worship, and
transportation to synagogues for other
services.
to Facilitator

In addition, Ruach invites speakers to address various aspects of Jewish life. Last year, the group sponsored a program investigating Jewish-Black relations. This year, they
plan to host members of SASS at
their Shabbat dinner. Upcoming
events include the Full Circle Theater, an interactive theater group,
which will address issues of prejudice. The performance, funded by
the Cooper Foundation, will take
place on November 4.
Swarthmore Christian Fellowship
SCF is "a non-denominational
community of students who follow
Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior," states the Guide to Student Life.
President Tara Robbins '95 says the
group's goal is to "show people that
we believe that God loves us, and we
believe that God loves Swarthmore."
Robbins emphasizes that all members of the group focus on their personal relationships, as Christians,
with Jesus Christ

In this vein, the group performs
services for the community. For example, many may recall receiving a
popsicle from a member of SCF during Registration at the beginning of
the semester.
The groupholds Friday night"large
group" gatherings, often attended by
45 to 50people, whichinvolve singing, worship, refreshments, and a
generally informal atmosphere.
SCF also organizes Bible study
groups in each dorm. These are intendedprimarily for Christians.There
are also Investigative Bible Study
(IBS) groups, for persons who are
interested in Scripture, without any
distinction of belief. IBS is open to
everyone, no matter what their reason for joining.
The group also organizes transportation to a variety of churches for
Sunday worship. In addition, itholds
prayer meetings twice daily in the
Christian Fellowship room in Bond
basement. An intercessory prayer
team is available, to fulfill prayer
requests for anyone on campus. The
group also organizes retreats.
Robbins asserts that SCF works to
combat the stereotype which prevails
of what it means to be a Christian or
a member of a Christian group. "We
have found," she says, "that itis very
different to be a Christian student at
Swarthmore." SCF is not closedminded, she says;it is a rational group.
She also stresses that SCF is nonpolitical. The beliefthat a connection
exists between SCF andany political
group is simply wrong, she says.
Catholic Campus Ministry
The Catholic student organization
is "vibrant, with an emphasis oncommunity," say Father John Freeman
and Susan Harte, the Catholic Campus Ministers who lead the group.
The Ministry holds masses on Sunday evenings at 6:30 in Bond, which
are open to all students.
The group also hosts community
events, open to everyone. The next
will beaTri-College worship service
and spaghetti dinner, in which the
Caritas group will also participate. It
will be held this Sunday, October 25,
in the Friends' Meetinghouse at 4
p.m. They have retreats once per semester. The leaders are also available

Sharples Hires LearningDisabled Employees
By Paul Krause
Linda McDougall is showing why
she won an award this summer for
herservice with the learning-disabled.
McDougall, Dining Services Director at Swarthmore, and the Delaware
County IntermediateUnit (DCIU) are
helping learning-disabled students to
organize, lead, and work in their own
cleaning company, which is contracted to Sharpies dining hall.
"DCIU Custodial Service" includes some 30 members, ranging in
age from 18 to 30. A supervisor job
coach directsand helps with thewhole
operation, but most of the work is
done by the 18 company members.
They mop, clean, and scrub enthusiastically because they are working
for their own business. "Every day
they're getting better, and they're
very dedicated to what they do,"
McDougall said.
Work at the college is just a start
for the fledgling company. Hopefully,
one of its members will eventually
rise to be a supervisor of his own
peers. McDougall and DCIU hope
that this program may work well
enough that similar projects may be
established with commercial chains,
such as the Pathmark Supermarkets.
for discussion with persons interested
in learning more about Catholicism.
The group also organizes community service work. Over Fall break,
students worked with a community
organization in North Philadelphia.
Volunteers helped renovate public
housing, which "was pretty dilapidated, because the system is often too
entangled to get money to the lowincome families living in it," says

The ideafor the new company arose
because the previous dining hall
cleaning group, which was hired
through a private contractor, was providing average work at high prices.
McDougall, who hired eightworkers
through DCIU to work at the dining
hall, then recommended the College
hire DCIU members to be cleaning
crew members and that they form an
independent business with which the
Collegewould form a contract.
The new cleaning staff and their
employer both seem happy with the
arrangement. The cleaning staff enjoy working for their own company
and McDougall is pleased with their
work. Unlike the last crew, with
whomcommunication was difficult,
McDougall is able to keep track of
the crew and their suggestions
through a correspondence log.
McDougall hopes that the project
succeeds and serves as a model for
other learning-disabled individuals
to form their own companies.
"They're just a great bunch of kids,
they'rereally fun," said McDougall.
"And it's a good experience for the
hourly employees, who take them
under their wing. I think they have
taught the hourly employees lessons
about how to be committed."

Erik Thoen '95, who participated in
the project. "Community work embodies the tradition of social justice
which is strong in our faith," says
Harte.
Information about all of these
groups is available on the bulletin
boards in Parrish. Contact persons
and upcoming events are listed. All
groups are eager to hear from anyone
interested.

Faculty Research Support Committee.Furthermore, all faculty members employed at least
half-time are eligible for health insurance.
There are some distinctions in benefits, however. Swarthmore contributes money to the
retirement funds of professors, but this contribution is pro-rated, so the tenured professors
who eventually have higher salaries (because
they stay longer at the College) will necessarily
receive more retirement money from the College. Swarthmore offers a mortgage loan to
professors who are tenured or who have more
than three years in their appointment. This
provision excludes almostall non-tenure-track
faculty. Tenure-track and regular part-time faculty are also eligible for tuition assistance for
the college education of two children, but the
part-time faculty receive smaller grants.
Keith said that about five years ago, former
Provost James England and President Al Bloom
began to revise Swarthmore's tenure policy. In
an attempt to provide students with a greater
continuity of faculty and to heighten the quality
of the faculty, several temporary positions are
being converted to tenure-track positions.
state

On Thursday, October 6, State Representative Tom Gannon spoke at a study break sponsored by the Swarthmore College Republicans. Representative Gannon, a Republican,
has represented Swarthmore Borough for a
total of eight terms. The Representative, whois
currently running for re-election, spoke on a
variety of issues according to event organizer
Matt Schenk '95.
Gannon discussed issues concerning the interaction between state and federal government, including unfunded current mandates
TENUREIL.from page 1

enable senior faculty members to conduct research rather than teach, non-tenured faculty
members at Swarthmore often teach a broad
range of courses and seminars.
AAUP asserts thatuniversities have come to
rely more heavily on part-time faculty for the
economic advantage of paying them less than
the equivalent paid to full-time faculty. A
smaller investment in temporary faculty also
results in inequitable working conditions, lack
ofresearch and travel funds, and unavailability
of health and life insurance plans.
At Swarthmore, however, the discrepancy in
compensation and opportunity for career advancement between tenure-track and temporary faculty members is not as marked. Keith
stated that temporary faculty members who
work at least half-time at Swarthmore receive
many of the same benefits as tenured professors. All full-time faculty members, whether
tenure-track or temporary, are equally eligible
for travel funds to attend professional meetings
and are candidates to receive funds from the

improvement and other state projects. On its
own, Pennsylvania will be spending a consider-

able amount of money in
funding emissions testing.
The representative spoke
strongly against such un-

funded mandates from the
federal government, saying they are a restriction of
states' rights.
Representative Gannon
also spoke about "motor

Gannon is one of the few speakers that
Swarthmore has hosted from the state legislature. According to Schenk, who is also the
Swarthmore College Republicans' liaison to
the Swarthmore Borough Republican Committee, "It was interesting to get a different perspective from the state level" concerning political activity.
Keith said thatno one in a temporary position
has come forward to her to express dissatisfaction with job security. She said that "naturally

tenured positions." Nevertheless, these faculty

had not been made aware of this situation
beforehand and responded that "if you're in

When the possibility of instituting alternative meal plans was raised, Schall responded
that because "the dining hall is still open,
whether or not you're eating your meal there,"
the cost differential between, say, a 15-meal
per week and a 20-meal per week plan wouldbe
negligible.
As stated in the Guide to Student Life,
"Sharpies Management Staff practices an open
door policy and welcomes your suggestions
and comments."

Times like these make me embarrassed to be from California.
Each day I pick up a paper, I confront a sense of helpless grief as the
most nightmarish endgame of moneyed interest politics gets played
out in my home state's senatorial
race.
The story-line sounds rather familiar, a relatively unknown rich
oil tycoon has bought his way into
state politics, and now plans to spend
$2O million to become a senator.

Mandatory Parental Consent Laws Restrict
a Woman's Fundamental Right to Choose
By Marybeth Lenkevich
Do your parents know everything
about you? While most of us might
place trust in those who love us, others, for fear of their safety, or to
protect theirprivacy, decline to share
intimate information. And many,
when forced, will resort to anything
not to reveal their secrets.
These issues emerge when facing
thedifficultdecision of an unplanned
pregnancy. In many states, however,
laws try to force family communication about the sensitive issue of teenage pregnancy. While no woman
should be forced to make such a decision alone, the state ought to respect her right to do so. Laws that
force minors to talk aboutpregnancy
actually jeopardize the young
woman's safety by increasing illegal
and self-inducedabortion, along with
the added dangers associated with
unwanted (and often unsafe) childbirth.
Pennsylvania, for example, has one
of the strictest abortion laws in the
country. The Abortion Control Act
requires one biological parent (the
difficult and unnecessary infringementhereshould be obvious) to come
to the required counseling session to
discuss the young women's options,
and again, twenty-four hours later, to
sign therelease form for the procedure. This places added financial restraints on abortions that discriminate against the poor. One result of
this act has been the decline in young
women seeking abortions in the
state—and a similar percentage increase in New Jersey. The judicial
bypass—a supposed "loophole" to
gain court permission for the procedure without parental notification, is
not only difficult for poor women
who can't afford legal counsel to
help them through the process, or
extremely traumatic in its own right,

but is also required for a woman's
legal guardian. Despite these restrictions, many of these laws are unnecessary. Stanley Henshaw and Kathryn
Kost noted in 1992 that states without mandatory parental consent
laws—7s% of minors under 16 involve one or both parents.
There are often horrifying stories
and statistics in states who do have
these restrictive abortion laws. Of
those minors who did not choose to
tell their parents about their abortion
procedures, 30% had experienced
violence in the home, feared violence, or being forced to leave
(Henshaw and Kost). The horror story
of Rebecca Bell proves how devastating these laws are for both the
young women and their families. Bell,
an Indiana woman from a loving
home, felt that she simply could not
tell her parents about her pregnancy,
and died from an illegal abortion
rather than face the parental consent
restriction. Rebecca's mother, on a
speaking tour atS warthmore in 1992,
confessed to her former support of
parental consentlaws, having thought
that her daughter would have been
able to come to her.

Domestic violence affects as many
as four million women a year in the
U.S. The New York Times reported
that 55% ofchildren in families where
the adult woman is beaten also suffer
from physical violence. One in five
female children are sexually assaulted. According to a briefing paper for the Center for Reproductive
Law and Policy, these women, who
either become pregnant through incest or otherwise, genuinely fear for
their safety and may not elect to inform their parents of an unplanned
pregnancy. Yet many states still require "communication" in these
households.
The devastating dangers of teen
pregnancy are well documented.

Martha Burt in 1986 estimated children of teenage mothers are twice as
likely to die in infancy as those bom
of women in their twenties. Young
women are over 24 times more likely
to die from giving birth than from

Howard Ory in 1983.
But you might be asking yourself,
"Why should I care? I'm over 18."
The truth is. Roe v. Wade assured
every woman's right to choose a safe,
legal abortion—regardless of race,
class, or age. Laws intended to restrict thisbasic privacy right threaten
all women's rights to choose family
planning options that are right for
them. Parental consent and notification laws restrict young women underthe false pretense of encouraging
family communication. These laws
only reinforce fear and interfere with
the rights of women to make their

A Gun Club for Quakers?
By Andy Feldman

This Sunday night, the Student Council will

a relatively high percentage of conscientious objector
during war time. SAFER would therefore go directly

vote

on

a

charter for a new organization called SAFER: S warthmore
Advocates of Firearm Education and Recreation. SAFER
plans to teach interested students how to properly use a

gun through a demonstration video as well as actual
instruction and practice at a shooting range. As the proposed charter states: "SAFER merely tries to ensure that if
students happen to come into contact with firearms, they
will know how to use them
safely. ..SAFER does not necessarily encourage the use of
firearms outside ofcontrolled
training facilities, and does
not encouragestudents to arm
themselves."
Many of us at S warthmore
have strong opinions about
guns, freedom, and how our
school interacts with its
Quaker heritage. Because of
this, many students also have
strong opinions on whether
this charter should be approved. A first step towards a
consensus, or at least an understanding of the whole issue, would be to review the
major arguments ofeach side.
I will summarize them for

tolerance (in this case, tolerance to people who want to
leam about guns) also a Quaker value?" They said yes, but
explained that when tolerance and non-violence are in
conflict, non-violence is the more important value. In
recent years, students have continued to demonstrate a
strong anti-violence tradition.Swarthmore has always had

against the founding faith of this school and the contin
ued practice of this tradition on campus.
On the other hand, this school is no longer officially
Quaker, although we maintain some Quaker tradition
and spirit. But it seems unfair to reject a club's charter on
religious grounds when Swarthmore has no official reli
gious obligations. Further, SAFER complies with Stu

I am quite skeptical about how

The second option for the superhighway an extension of the World Wide
Web, seems more appetizing. At least
at first glance. Anyone whohas played
with Mosaic or one of the other Web
browsers knows what a complete joy
and a complete pain in the ass it is to
navigate theWeb. From a voyeuristic
viewpoint; the Web is great fun. If
you pop some Curve or early Thrill
Kill Kult into the CD player, you
almost feel like a character from
Neuromancer. From apractical standpoint, however, the Web is nearly
useless tomost people. Trying to use
the Web to gather information for a
paper or research is impossible—the
images you need either are not be
available or are impossible to find,
and the text you did get a hold of is in
French. For research, the Web seems
best used for its original purpose:
facilitating communication amongst
physicists.
People are hoping that things will
change with commercial business
entering the Web, the Web will take
on a more easily navigable form. So
far there are a number of on-line
companies that sell flowers, CDs,
and clothes, butfew provide any sense
of order or sanity. The services of-

fered by these companies are, for the
most part, completely useless. Without The Web you can call a

flowershop and request FTDsend an
arrangement anywhere in the world.
You can pop down to nearly any CD
store and ask them to special order
something not available. When ordering clothes over the net you can't
try anything on—all you have to go
by are grainy pictures. Granted, you
don't have to talk to anyone when
using the Web, butfor most thatis no
incentive. The Web has a long way
to go before it becomes anything
more than mind candy.
It's interesting to note that amongst
the differences between the proposed
telco-cable and World Wide Web
superhighways, the former is national while the latter is international.This fact alone (despite making the information superhighway
even more nebulous and confusing)
makes a successor to the WorldWide
Web infinitely more appealing. It
just might help America out of its
egocentric isolationist shelland teach
it to interact with the rest of the
world. The World Wide Web also
has greater potential for expansion
into something more useful. It is
important to remember, though, that
it looks as though both the proposed

Believe It: Professional Athletes Earn Their Salaries
By Dave McGrail
With the sudden halt of the professional baseball and hockey
seasons, the media and fans alike are attacking the "greed" which
has left the owners and players at a stalemate. As a result of this

brouhaha the salaries of all professional athletes have
become an object of public discussion and discontent.
Fans hold up signs reading "I'll play for free." There
are threereasons why the professional athlete deserves
to take in as much as he or she does, why the NBA's
best center shouldnot be scorned for wearing $ 100,000
of gold around his neck, why the premier golfer on the
LPGA tour has every right to drive a Ferrari.
For starters, the reason "disgusting" salaries are
pulled in by these athletes is that we, the fans, yearn to
see these individuals in action. The World Series
dominatesT.V. ratings for a good week, and people are
so eager to watch college football that the most exciting games are now on pay-per-view. The only way I
will be able to get really good seats to see the UPenn/
Princeton basketball game this year is because my
friend there has a friend that knows somebody... or
something like that. Not only college basketball, but Ivy League
basketball is huge! The whole thing is a simple case of supply and
demand. I can't speak for the stalemate between baseball owners
and players, but I can say that the public pays a great deal of money
to see sports events, and I think it hypocritical of a fan to buy a

ticket, go to a baseball game,and thenhold up a sign reading
"Cut player salaries. They don't deserve the money." The
major league pitcher earns so much because Major League
Baseball is an industry which the American not only keeps
afloat but allows to flourish.
Secondly, theseindividuals are the
best in America at what they do.
Spielberg is probably the best U.S.
movie director right now, and nobody
complains that he is making so many
millions (or billions or whatever) of
dollars. Henry Kravis, the man who
"pioneered the leverage buyout," (at
least this is how he was introduced at
my graduation) is a fabulous businessmen, although not a particularly
charming character. I have yet to hear
someone criticize his enormous fortune. I mean, he made it fair and
square (although at the expense of
many a small business). If the baseball salaries are going to be criticized
then why not the annual income of Bill Gates?These people are
at the top of their respective professions because they are,
supposedly, the best at what they do. There are only 800 major
league baseball players, and only a handful of them make more
than one million dollars a year. Ifsomebody wants to challenge

the salaries of all of the wealthy people in America that is fine.
But for the capitalists out there it not fair to single out the
professional athlete as the paragon of avarice.
Oh, I see. The reason they shouldn't get paid so much is
because what they are doing is "fun." Allright then.Let's switch
the guy with the "I'll play for free" sign with Former N. Y. Giant
Lawrence Taylor. I once heard that L.T., in his prime, did 3000
push-ups and 2000 sit-ups per day. And then he started his
workout. Barry Bonds spends an unbelievable amount of time
traveling, and Wayne Gretzky hardly ever sees his family. Not
only that, the off-seasonfor the professional athlete is anything
but fun and games. Sure, they may enjoy their work, but how
does this differ from the hard-working doctor who revels in
helping patients? You may respond that the athlete doesn't
benefit society in anyway. Think again. What about the millions
of blue-collar workers who find their livelihood in the Sunday
football games or the kid who idolizes a baseball player or the
tired S wattie who needs to sitdown for a few minutes and watch
a yellow ball whiz methodically back and forth over a net.
Professional athletes are in demand, carry a unique talent, and
work hard. I see no reason why they don't deserve to make what
they do. As for the struggle between players and owners, this is
an entirely different topic in which greed may play a part.
However, the idea of limiting Karl Malone's salary to that of a
mechanic is ludicrous. Besides, you try telling M alone that he's
going to make $lO an hour.

Sara Jansson: Swarthmore's Answer to Devito's Renaissance Man
By Jennifer Sorowitz

Swedish or be really Japanese—at
least say, 'I am from here and I
relate here,'" she said. "That's one
reason I wanted to come to the
States—everyone's a foreigner here,

except for Native Americans, and
everyone has a diverse background."

Some of Jansson's extracurricular
Studying for classes and finding
time to socialize as well as catch a
activities include singing in Doppler
few z's is never easy at Swat. Add to
Gang, an a cappella group, and playthat participating in several extracurricular activities and you have either
a very crazed person or a very welladjusted, well-balanced student.
Sara Jansson, '97, is the latter. She
has been able to balance her commitments to classes, sports, and
clubs, not to mention finding time to
hang out with friends and even fight
for a personal cause or two.
Her busy schedule is not the onlything that makes her unique.
Jansson's mother is Japanese and
her father is Swedish. Jansson was
born in Tokyo and lived there for the
first 12 years of her life. Her family
then moved to the Philippines; after
two years her parents returned to
Japan and she and her brother went
to boarding school in Sweden.
Because of her varied upbringing
she is fluent in three languages,
English, Japanese, and Swedish. In
addition, she is studying French here
at Swarthmore.
Though she is proud of her
diverse background, Jansson has
sometimes been faced with conflicting emotions because of it. "In a
way, you can relate to a lot of people, but, then again, you can't relate
to anybody," she said. "When I'm in
Sweden, some people call me foreigner; when I'm in Japan, some

In Sam Schulhofer-Wohl's
Chicago neighborhood, there were
regulars. The man who slept on the
bench, one of 40,000 men, women,
and children on 40,000 Chicago
benches, had become a familiar

Suddenly,
Sam was coping
with the not-socommon experience of dealing with
the homeless oneon-one, sometimes
as coworkers, but
more importantly,
as human beings.
"I'd never really known a homeless person as a friend. I'd never had
a conversation with a homeless person about how they got to be homeless," he said, about his preStreetWise attitude.
Sam was able to spend May
working for the paper thanks to a
program which allows high-school
seniors to take their last month off to
experience any type of educational
work, travel or play.
Since StreetWise is an organization with relatively few employees,
Sam gained knowledge of many
facets of newspaper publishing dur-

jobs included everything from clerical work, to writing about the city's
crack problem, to training the homeless vendors to be more savvy salesmen. Essentially, he gained an insider's perspective on both the workings of a newspaper and the workings of an inner

paper.
During this period they not learn
basic sales strategies, but are also
exposed to outreach programs, such as narcotics
and alcohol counseling, and assistance in finding housing, clothing,
and food. Sam found that one of his
greater challenges was convincing
vendors to actually read the paper so
that they could sell their product bet-

StreetWise made him more cynical.
"I knew that there were all these

"Think for yourself and don't let us

be something that gives you lots of
money; that's a good fringe benefit,
but that's not one of my top priorities. It's more making sure I'm helping other people and feeling good
about myself."
Jansson will probably major in
Economics with a concentration in
Women's Studies, and possibly
International Relations. "I think it's
interesting to see how other people
have thought and to see what they
base their viewpoints on and to figure out your own way of thinking

With Bared Teeth

You*re probably going to see Pulp Fiction this week, but if you've
got the time for two movies, try to get out and see Frank Darabont's The
Shawshank Redemption. It's a funny, warm movie about friendship and
what happens when the human spirit is caged.
The movie is about two men inside of Maine's Shawshank prison.
Both are convicted of murder and serving life sentences. Andy Dufrane
(Tim Robbins) is a man who is wrongly convicted of killing his wife and
her lover* Red (Morgan Freeman) is "the only guilty man in
Shawshank-** Red is the type ofconvict who can smuggle anything into
the prison. Andy is a quiet banker who gets protection from the guards
m return for handling their tax returns. The movie follows their friendshipias it develops over the course of twenty years.
I expected a chched piece of filmmaking, I mean, how many prison
movies can people make? Sure, there
were several elements of the prison
movie genre, but the story moved
beyond that* keeping a pace which
defied a potentially snail-paced script.
The film is based on a Stephen King
short story and shows us what happens
when the human spirit is locked away.
Red and another inmate, Brooks, have found their niche in the prison
life; they're comfortable and completely unprepared for any freer style
of life. We see the destructiveeffect of imprisonment on the spirit when
Brooks is paroled. There is similar confusion in Red's life. On the other
end of the spectrum, there's Andy, whose spirit seems cowed by his time
in prison, but in reality has strengthened in retaliation.
The Shawshank Redemption is very funny and warm, yet it has a
darker, more violent side to it, seen in the mistreatment of prisoners and
the cruelty ofinmates. I highly recommend seeing this movie for the storyline and stellar performances by Robbins and Freeman. Kudos to firsttime director Darabont. Shawshank gets something between mint
chocolate chip ice cream and stuffed shells. Maybe a french dip....

Sports
Women's Rugby
The Women's rugby team traveled to the
Universtiy ofDelaware on Saturday to play a
team that was, literally and figuratively, out
of their league. The good news is that the
game was non-league and relatively unimportant and none of Swat's players were
seriously injured (except Rebecca Hill '95
whobroke her finger, but kept playing). The
bad news is that these ruggers lost 41-0. It
was not that the team played poorly, though.
Rather, Delaware was big, strong, fast, and
skilled— a killer combination. Even though
Swarthmore's team play was obviously
smarter, that fact alone couldn not make up
for the size differentialbetween the two teams.
Swat'sA-side was indeed crushed, but the Bside played a strong additional 30 minutes
and finished their game with a score of 0-0.

Women's Soccer Nears End With Tough Break Games
By Jill Wildonger
Coming off Sunday's win
against HollinsCollege in Virginia,
the 3-12 women's soccer team
circled the Bryn Mawr pitch like
vultures during their pregame laps.
Hungry for another win, the team
came on strong from thefirst whistle.
Scoring started early, with the Bryn
Mawr striker finding the net in the
first minutes of play. Unimpressed,
Swarthmore raged downfield, and a
pass to the center at the 20 yard line
set up mid-fielderRobinCanada '96
for her dazzling over-the-keeper
goal. The first half finished with
tough play by both teams and no
further score. In the second half,
Bryn Mawr's second goal was

quickly reciprocated whenforward
Madeline Fraser '95 took a ball
from Bess O'Neill '95 and spun it
into the far corner. Swarthmore
played intensely; strong defensive
support from backs Heather
Maloney '95 and Sara Guroff '96
kept the ball at the feet of
Swarthmore attackers Meredith
Linn '97 and Betsy Rosenbaum '9B,
while sweeper Claire Baxter '9B
kept the goal area free ofBrynM awr
traffic with well-placed clears.
FreshmanBeth Wiles displayed her
soccer flexibility through strong
play in mid-field and defensive positions. With the score tied again,
Bryn Mawr snuck another ball into
the net, making the score 2-3. Not
giving up, Swarthmore dug deep.

In the last ten minutes of play, Linn
tipped a ball to Fraser who jammed a
searing shot past the Bryn Mawr
keeper into the net, tying the game
and sending it into a half-hour overtime feud. Playing with conviction,
Swarthmore tussledrelentlessly with
Bryn Mawr. Bryn Mawr scored the
winning goal in the second fifteen
minute half, but a tenacious
Swarthmore team continued to play
hard almost tying again with an indirect kick by Claire Baxter '9B in the
last twenty seconds.

The loss to Bryn Mawr follows
the team's 1-2 record over October
break. Returning early to duel with
Franklin and Marshall on Clothier
Field, Swarthmore lost 2-0 before

wild, scoring four goals to Ho 11ins'
one. The Swat offense smashed
through the mid-field and defense to
pepper continuous shots on goal.
Fraser scored twice in the first half;
her second goal, shot from beside the
net on the end line, defiedall laws of
geometry in its incrediblesweep past
the goalie. Unsatisfiedwith two goals,
Fraser smoked another ball into the
net for a hat trick. Baxter, fidgeting
for her own score, switched with
Canada in the mid-field multiple
times and assisted Betsy Rosenbaum
in her goal.

Football Starts Break With Victory Over Muhlenburg
By Nathan Hegedus
In the last two weeks, the GarnetTide had an
overwhelming victory on the road at
Muhlenberg and a disappointing loss at home
to Hobart in a non-league game.
Building on the first win of the season the
week before, Swarthmore came out on fire
against the Muhlenberg Mules. Swarthmore
dominatedevery facet of the game. The 43-17
win was the largest margin of victory in the
tenure of any coach or player. The offense
could not be stopped, especially in the second
half. Swarthmore went into half-time with a
18-10 lead. They missed no opportunities in
the second half. Quarterback Pat Straub '97
completed 10 of 14 passes for 179 yards, and
threw two touchdowns and rushed for one.
Sam Paschel '96 was on the receiving end of
most of those yards with five catches for 112
yards and two touchdowns. NickMilligan '96
added to Muhlenberg's pain with two one yard
touchdown runs. Freshman quarterback Aaron
Zwicker '9B came in thefourth quarter to lead
the offense to its last touchdown on a run by
Eddie Shin '97.
Defensive back Matt Wiggins, who plays
on both sides of the ball, was named the coconference player of the week, with his two
interceptions and three tackles. The
Swarthmore defense picked off three passes
and put continualpressure on the harried Mule
Quarterback. Senior Captain Pete Steelman
summed up the game by saying "The team
clickedbetter than they have in a long time. It

was nice to finally blow someone out andrelax
in the second half."
Swarthmore took a two game winning streak
into the Hobart game against a team it had lost
to in a tough 20-13 game lastyear. The offense
drove down the field twice in the first quarter
but was unable to put any points on the board.
The defense, led by defensive back Mark Fink
'95 with twelve tackles, dominated the Hobart
offense through the first half as the teams
entered the locker rooms in a scoreless tie.
Swarthmore scored the first points of the
game on a pass from Pat Straub to his brother
Jason Straub '96. Hobart came right back to
take a 7-6 lead on a long run and never turned
back. Swarthmore could not mount an offensive attack against a tough Hobartdefense for
the remainder of the game and the defense
finally gave up a couple of long, time consuming drives. Special teams breakdowns were
also key, as Hobart blocked two punts; one for
the touchdown that put the game out of reach.
A disappointed Steelman said, "The defense
played a great game overall. But a few mistakes on offense and special teams late in the
gamekilled us." Hobart won the game 24-6.
Swarthmore goes into this week's game at
nationally ranked Dickinson with a 2-4 record
overall and a 2-2 record in the Centennial
Conference. A win against the Red Devils
would do wonders for Swarthmore's remaining title hopes as the team tries to build on the
Muhlenberg game and the positive side of the
Hobart loss.

Men's Cross Country dashes around Swarthmore in training for upcoming Centennial
Conference Championships.

Athletes of the Week

Men's Cross Country
Runs Over Allentown
While most Swarthmore students were on
break and fast asleep in faraway places, the
men's Cross Country team was on theroad at
8:00 A.M. this past Saturday, October 15th,
and headed for Allentown. As the team, led by
coachTed Dixon, sped towards their final des
tination, the opposition could feel the heat of
the approaching firebreathers. Undaunted by a
field of 35 teams, Swarthmore stepped out of
the van with an aura ofConfidence and warmed
up on the course that many on the squad had
seen twice or three times a year. The meet
featured both a varsity and a sub varsity race.
Around 11:15, the runners for the varsity
race lined up on the huge starting line to incorporate the approximately 220 runners. As
usual, the race started off quickly, with the
leaders going out at a sub 5:00 mile pace.
Swarthmore managed to push and shove their
way into contention early on. Gene Vann '95,
the man who has overcome initial injuries and
illnesses, placed himself among the top 20,
while JohnFreeman '96, Kerry Boeye '97, and
Steve Laubach '96 jostled for spots a little
further back. Around the third mile, freshman
Graham Lucks streaked forward and moved
into the third slot on the team.
Vann finished the race in a best ever 26:53
for 18thplace, and Boeye, fighting tendentious
of the knee, posted a time of 27:13 for 27th
place. Next came Lucks, who endured trash
talk from an Allentown runner to finish in an
amazing 27:28, good for 41st place. Freeman

managed to grab 45th place in 27:33, and John
Kane '95, despite a hellish buildup of lactic
acid, came in 27:56, good for 59th place. Sixth
man Laubach, whose shoe fell off in the mud
with 400 meters to go, was the team's sixth
runner in 28:01,66th place, and Aaron Bartley
grabbed the team's seventh spot with a time of
29:11.
The sub varsity race had a similarly huge
field. The team was led by Victor White '9B,
29:25, 27th place, who was competing for the
first time on the tough Allentown course. Junior Tom Fowler, treated to a diet of Maine
lobster and shrimp during his shortbreak, posted
a gritty showing despite open flesh wounds on
his feet, with a time of 29:55, 36th place. Jon
Cordell '95 and Doug Sloane '95 overcame
problems with the hot midday sun to finish in
31:29 and 31:43, 59th and 63rd places. Gene
Yoshida '9B was next in 33:23,78 th, and junior
Matt Reed rounded out the Swarthmore sub
varsity squad with a time of 34:20, 80th place.
Given a measly rating in the region,
Swarthmore varsity undoubtedly surprised
many by grabbing fourth place behind perennial powerhouse Haverford, Kutztown (division II), and Gettysburg. The strong showing
gave the team reason to hope for a darkhorse
shot at the NCAA Division 111 championship.
Though three hard weeks of training lie ahead,
the Cross Country team has grown together
over the past few weeks and is gearing up for
Centennials on October 29 and NCAA division
111 regionals on November 12.

and a stress fracture of the femur over the

to come like magic" for Vann, who has
spent more time in the pool rehabilitating
than on the roads in the past few years.

Madeline Fraser'9s is a
forward on the women's soccer team.
This past week Fraser led Swat to victory over Hollins College of Virginia
with a hat trick. She then added two
more goals in a 3-4 overtimeloss to Bryn
Mawr. Her second goal in the last ten
minutes of regulation allowed Swat to
pull Bryn Mawr into extra minutes.
Says a teammate of Fraser, "She goes
after every ball 100%. Many of her
goals come because of her hustle—just
by moving as fast as she possibly can."
Added another teammate, "Madeline is
definitely an offensive threat. She has a
strong move-to the net and a good firm
foot."

Swarthmore's Women Volleyball rallied
from a disappointing finish in the Seven Sisters' Tournament with a win at Bryn Mawr
and first place in the Cabrini Tournament last
week. They carried a six game winning streak
into Tuesday night's match against
Muhlenberg. Apre-game ceremony was held
to recognize the contributions of the team's
five seniors, Suzanna Brauer, Nicki Levine,
Maryßeiler, Yvonne Lui, and Rachel McKaig,
before the final home match of their careers.
With the support of the pep band and an
usually large and vocal crowd, Swarthmore
jumped outto a 9-1 lead in the first game with
some of their most dominating play this season.
Swarthmorehas shown its ability to dominate the opposition all season. At Seven Sisters', they took a gamefromfinalistWellesley
15-0. In the finals of the Cabrini Tournament,
they swept Beaver 15-0, 15-10. However,
Swarthmore eventually lost the Muhlenberg
match 13-15, 9-15, 13-15 and the Wellesley
match 6-15,15-0, 8-15.
Swarthmore's six game winning streak followed a 1-4 performance and sixth place at
the Seven Sisters' Tournament. Swat exacted a measure of revenge against Bryn

Mawr, to whom they lost in the tournament,
15-6, 6-15, 15-10, 15-9. McKaig led the
hitteis with 11 kills. Swarthmore swept all
five of its matches to win the Cabrini Tournament. Their first victim was Delaware Valley
15-10, 15-5. They then defeated defending
champion Delaware Tech 15-12,12-15,15-5.
Jordan Hay '9B had 30 set assists and 2 aces.
McKaig had 12 kills and Nancy Rosenbaum
'95 had 10. Lui had 5 kills and 7 remarkable
aces, part of her tournament high of 24 aces.
Against Keystone-Juniors, McKaig was
dominating, racking up 15 kills and an ace.
Swarthmore dominated, as every member of
the team had an ace in this match. Swat rolled
through the semifinals andfinals and defeated
Marywood 15-10,15-4 and Beaver 15-0, 1510. Lui had a solid match with 6 digs, 5 aces,
and 3 kills and Beiler was the "woman of the
hour," according to Coach Perry, with 8 kills
and 2 aces.
Rosenbaum still leads all Centennial Conference hitters in overall hitting percentage of
.405. The team is tied for first in overall aces

averaging 3.22 a match, not including the
CabriniTournamentstatistics where Lui alone
averaged 4.8 per match.
Currently, Swarthmore is 11-11 with four
remaining away matches against Princeton,
Ursinus, Johns Hopkins, and Albright.
