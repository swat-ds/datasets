Controversy Over
Kohlberg Art
Glass Continues

Discussion Focuses on Racial Issues
on Nation of Islam leader Louis
Farrakhan, thepresence of Maya Angelou
and Rosa Parks at the march was virtu-

About 40 studentsconvened to discuss
race relations in the United States and on
campus in the wake of the O.J. Simpson
trial and the Million Man March on
Wednesday afternoon in the Women's
Resource Center.
The discussion, entitled "Race in
America: We Aren't Even on the Same
Planet'." was organizedby NiYa Costley
'97, Co-President of the Swarthmore
African-American Student Society. Assistant Professor of Religion Yvonne
Chireau and Professor of English Peter
Schmidt facilitated the discussion.

Different

ally ignored.
Rebeccah Bennett '96 emphasized that
while "the whole Nation of Islam push"
is the empowerment of black men, the
main focus of the media's portrayal of it
is always on hateful speech. She remarked
that since"black maleleaders have been
predominantlyreligious," they have come
from a "black church [which like other
churches] has conflicting emotions about
gayness." Confronting prejudices within
the black community and its leadership
should not just be viewed as a recent
phenomenon.
Bennett elaboratedfurther, saying that
she resented the focus on Farrakhan and
"as a black woman...was happy that my
black brothers were out there doing what
they had to do." Although she does not
agree with all of Farrakhan's views, she
also believes that "nobody can tell me
who can be my leader," and thatthe same
should be the case for the white commu-

Planets

Chireau began the discussion by wondering whether newly highlighted racial
divisions stand in the way of thecreation
of a common community. She cited a
newspaper article that reported "bewilderment from certain segments of the
white population" as to why the Million
Man March was necessary.
Patrice Bone '96 said, "Why is the
different planet issue suddenly a light
bulb?" She has felt a gulf between racial
groups ever since her childhood, and
cannot understand why it is considered
"black people's fault that we [as a society] are racially polarized."
Jason Zengerle '96 said, "It's a light
bulb for white people," who had viewed
Simpson as a "non-racial entity" and thus
were surprised thathecould "solicit such
support" frommembersof theblack community.
Vincent Jones '9B remarked that, in
general, blacks and whites looked at the
gathering of evidence for the Simpson
trial in different ways. Hebelieves whites
were more likely to trust police officers
and the DNA evidence they uncovered,
and that blacks were skeptical of the
police as a source of evidence.
In evaluating these issues, people
should ask themselves, "How have my
own personal experiences with police
influenced how I judge how police departments' work in general?" Schmidt
said.
He elaboratedlater that "race and class
can make a real difference here, creating
much intelligent skepticism toward how
police sometimes handle evidence."

nity.

Chireau concurred about the media
portrayal, saying that the focus on the
march was inmany cases shifted to "white
fears and anxieties."Schmidt felt that the
emphasis on black men's atonement for
what they had done wrong was an attempt by the white media "to shape how
the 'positive' aspects of the march should
be understood."
The Feelings Behind the Rhetoric
Sharon Coleman '9B, however, could
not dismiss Farrakhan, saying "it scares
me...[when] I know what his feelings
about my community are" and that this
march was instrumental in "empowering" Farrakhan. She felt thatit could only
be a matter of time before he acted upon
the sentiments that lay behind his statements.

Maria Lin '96 then commented that
"people are coming away from this
[march] empowered individually for what
they need to do in theircommunities. ..they
don't need a hero [like Farrakhan] as a
crutch."
Jones noted that Farrakhan not only
made negative statements about other
groups; he also cast aspersions upon
blacks. He also pointed out the double
standard by which white leaders who
make ostensibly hateful comments, including Former President Ronald Reagan
and presidential candidate Bob Dole, are
not "vilified" to the same degree as
Farrakhan.
Bone remarked that "blacks and Jews
have lost touch...While we once identified ourselves as oppressed peoples," the
success of a comparatively high number
of Jews inreaching the"upper echelons"
ofAmerican society has made this identification a more tenuous one. She noted

Race and the Media

Alyssa Rayman-Read '99 noted that

sheand hermother attended a conference
on gender and technology in London at
the time of the Million Man March. At
the conference, they met women from
Zimbabwe who felt that the Simpson
case and the Million Man March "reduced the power ofblack women in particular." The Zimbabwean women also
found it curious that, with the emphasis

further that Speaker of the House Newt
Gingrich scared her, and he was in a
position of great power which a person
like Farrakhan would never be able to
obtain.
Eric Mealy '97 believes that
Farrakhan's widely publicized "bloodsucker" comment must be viewed in its
proper context. Mealy said thatFarrakhan
"was discussing theproblem of absentee
landlords in the black community. He
said that various groups, including Jews
and Koreans, have come into black communitiesbuying up all the businessesand
residences. The problem arises when
black people spend their money paying
rent, and buying groceries, [but] noi; of
the money is redistributed to empower
the community."
Mealy is also troubled by those who
are afraid of Farrakhan, because he believes that on a certain level it shows that
"people are truly afraid of black people,
especially black men, reconciling the differences they have with each other, and
coming together to better themselves."
Farrakhan was just"one man with one set
of ideas," andfor Mealy, themarch wasn't
"about leadership as much as it was about
representation. As a black man, I'm not
looking for a leader to tell me what to do
or how to think."
Josh Freker '99 noted that in his predominantly white community at home in
Michigan, "the white people I was talking to thought the march had a good
aim...[and] they weren't really afraid."
He told the group that he was "looking
for opportunities to get at differences"
between racial communities in order to
understand them better.
Jean Chen '96 felt that as an Asian
woman, she "slip[ped] through the
cracks" of the racial dialogue. She found
it "weird that the media would be outraged when Farrakhan says things about
Jews or Asians...getting mad in my
name," when otherwise the media themselves often portray Asians in a negative
light
Zengerle noted how the "constant focus on Farrakhan obscures larger and
more pressing matters." While he admits
that he does not agree with things
Farrakhan has said, Zengerle notes that
"all of the complaining isn't going to
make much of a difference in terms of
eradicating a lot of the problems in the
black community that Farrakhan also
addresses."
He felt that Jews should "not make
[Farrakhan] repudiate what he said as a
condition for beginning a dialogue," as
major Jewish organizations have demanded.
However, he hopes that such dialogue
might inspire him to "tone down his
rhetoric" in the future.

What Happened to the
Haunted House at Old Tarble?
By Kate Bernstein

The Public Safety Department decided

not to hold a haunted house at OldTarble

this Halloween because ofunsafe conditions in the building. Many students felt
that Halloween night at Swarthmore was
just not the same without the usual
haunted house at Old Tarble.
The already structurally unstablebuilding was never cleaned after the suspicious fire last February. Public Safety
was short on staffearlierthis year and did
not have enough people to devote to
preparing Old Tarble for the haunted
house. The status of Old Tarble is in
question. Thereis a good chance that the
building will be torn down. Therefore, a
decision was made not to spend money to
renovate it.
While the overriding opinion is that
the building will be torn down, Owen
Redgrave, Director of Public Safety,
would like to bring back the haunted

if the building is still available.
Redgrave said, "We really enjoyed
doing the hauntedhouse in the past years.
One of our initial goals was to make it a
public relations eventto get closer to the
students. Whether or not we bring back
the haunted house depends on the students."
Redgrave added, "Last year we did not
get any feedback from the community.
No one said 'Thank you,' and we did not
receive any coverage in the student publications. It would be nice to hear that the
students missed the haunted house this
year and want us to bring itback. It would
definitely help me make a decision if the
option arose."
Most students would probably agree
that Halloween was not the same without
thehaunted house. Lia Ernst '97 said, "I
definitely enjoyed the hauntedhouse the
last two years and thought it was a real
worthwhile activity. I would really like
to see it come back next year."

The new art glass in Kohlberg Hallhas
been the topic ofmuch discussion during
the past two weeks. Before many students had even seen the art glass, an allcampus E-mail was sent by Associate
Vice-President Larry Schall.The E-mail,
written in response to Professor of Economics Mark Kuperberg's note of concern regarding the art glass, alerted students that even members of the faculty
were expressing dismay over the new
glass. Professor Kuperberg feels so
strongly about the appearance of the art
glass windows in Kohlberg Hall that he
has organized a group called, "Stop
Installing the Glass Now (SIGN)." It was
Kuperberg's all-faculty E-mail which
prompted Schall to send an E-mail to the
entire campus.
Associate Vice-President Schall insists that despite the complaints he has
received about the windows, the "approach we're going to take no w is tokeep
the building as it was designed." He
supports taking a "wait and see approach,"
sinceit is simply a set of windows, and "it
can go up and it can go down." However,
he cautions, there are issues beyond just
whether the windows are aesthetically
pleasing. In many places where the art
glass is being installed, clear glass would
be inappropriate because wires, concrete,
or bathrooms wouldbe exposed. In addition, many rooms were designed with the
intention that less light would come in
through the art glass. Mr. Schall is talking to the architectabout alternatives, but
he believes people right now are just
experiencing an "initial shock [which to]
some may be overpowering." He added
that the glass should be allowed to be
experienced for a while after Kohlberg
opens before any decision about its future is made.
On theotherhand. President Al Bloom
says he did not realize that the panes
would be so opaque when he examined
the samples. "In this case I don'tthink we
are dealing with a question of whether
the glass is half-full or half-empty. To
my mind, it doesn't require much reflection for it to become transparent that
retaining all the "pains" would shatter
my vision of the building and its fit with
the campus environment
"Seriously, I dobelieve changes should
be made, and I will be meeting with the
architect on Tuesday to begin to frame an
approach," Bloom added.

Field Hockey Team Captures Conference Crown
By

Jean Qulnn

The Garnet captured the Centennial
Conference title and finished their season with an unblemished conference
record (9-0), and 16-3 overall after defeating Haverford 4-1 last weekend.
Swarthmore was winning theentiregame,
knocking in their quartet of goals before
Haverford scored theirlone point. Lurah
Hess "99 and Sam Peltz '97 each scored
once, and Lia Ernst '97 had two goals in
Swat's last outing.
Hess scored on a deflection off of a
penalty corner. Peltz likewise put the ball
in the cage on a rebound offof a penalty
corner. Ernst scored her two goals on
penalties also. "Haverford's defense was
relatively slow on comers, so they gave
me enough time to get a shot off," she
noted.

The entire team played well and dominated the game, even though the contest
was slow-paced in the beginning. According to Peltz, "Swat went out with a
quality win. It's easy for a team to play
beneath their potential when they are

facing a less skilled opponent. Swarthmore maintained a high level of play
throughout the match against Haverford."
While they did have some good players,
Ernst said that overall the Haverford squad
was not exceptionally talented. The rivalry between the schools contributed
more to the intensity of the game than the
quality of the competition.
With that victory, the Garnet clinched
the Conference Championship and finished with an undefeated record in the
Centennial Conference. Ernst cited that
since "there are many consistently strong
teams in the conference," garnering the
title was a great achievement.
Peltz likewise took pride in Swat's
accomplishment.' "When I came in as a
freshman, it was the goal of the team to
have at least a five hundred season. We
met that goal. Last year, we set our sights
higher and were striving for a Conference Championship. Though we had a
winning record, it was not good enough
to earn us that title. It is really exciting to
now be able to say that we are not only
Conference Champions, but that we are

also 9-0 in that conference," she commented.
Everyone on the team was disap-

pointed thatSwat did not get a bid to the
NCAA tournament, especially since
Wellesley, whom Swarthmore defeated
to win the Seven Sisters Tournament at
Smith, is in the post-season play.
Goucher, who beat the Garnet in an
intense, double-overtime game, also
gained a spot in the tournament. Peltz
felt thathad Swat won that game against
Goucher, the team would have had a
much more realistic chance of going
onto thenext level of play in the NCAA
Tournament. Ernst said, "We are just
unlucky to be in an exceptionally hard
region, so getting a bid is very difficult."
Season highlights for the team included winning the Seven Sisters Tournament, defeating Johns Hopkins and
Gettysburg, and developing as a unit.
The team does not rely on any one
player, but owes its victories to the
strengths of all its members. Congratulations on all the team's achievements,
especially their most recent triumph!

seen an increase in various offenses committed on campus. Outside of theresidence halls, Swarthrnore students have
been assaulted on threeoccasions (twice
in 1994 by Parrish Hall, and once near
Mary Lyons in 1995). In addition,
Swarthrnore residence halls have been
hit by suspicious fires, computer, and
bicycle burglaries in the past year. Owing to a marked increase in offenses
committed by off-campus individuals,
the safety measures proposed by Public
Safety are necessary and important.

a very safe place and that heightened
public safety efforts are not necessary.
The Housing Committee feels strongly
that students must be made aware of the
safety issues created by our proximity to
surrounding communities and the easy
access to residence halls due to our
"open-door" policies. Swarthrnore is a
safe campus; however, incidents have
occurred on campus and in residence
halls in recent years.
A Pro-Active Approach—lt is essential that the College be pro-active in
its approach to public safety issues. Installing outside telephones and locking
the residence halls may ensure that a
dorm assault may never take place on
the Swarthrnore campus again. We are
strongly in support of efforts to ensure
the safety of students before we are
pushed to stronger steps by a critical
incident.
For these reasons, the Housing Committee fully supports the efforts of the
administration and Public Safety to install outside telephones and lock the
residence halls. In addition, the Housing
Committee will begin a campus-wide
education effort to prevent "door-prop-

Registrar Reflects upon
Seminar Meeting
By Erik Huneke
Last Friday's seminar scheduling meeting was intended to change thetime frame
of negotiating seminar conflicts from to
the middle of the semester before they
take place. Some students and faculty
members at the meeting felt that the new
timing of this meeting did not address all
of the problems of the old system.
Registrar Martin Warner explains that
he "was asked by the Provost to try this
seminar conflict negotiation meeting"
following a suggestion by the Curriculum Committee. He comments that "it
was pretty clear...that faculty were feeling it was increasingly diffcult and objectionable to have to schedule seminars
around increasingly complex course and
extracurricular schedules" under the old
system. The meeting was supposed to
allow students to "have input about seminar schedules" before they were announced in the course catalog. Scheduling times for seminars in the catalog is
another aspect of the new approach.
Yet some students' Honors programs
now feature courses as integral components. Particularly for those in the new
Honors program, there is also lees of a
likelihood that they will enroll in more

than one seminar in a given semester, as
was the case for many of the students at
the meeting. Even if courses are not an
integral part of an Honors' students program, the locus of scheduling conflicts is
more likely to occur between seminars
and courses and between seminars.
By listening to student concerns,
Warnerhas recognized "the interrelated
ness of the importance of courses and
seminars." Yet he also thinks that "the
importance of seminars should not be
forgotten," since for most students, they
are still themain route by which a student
can attain"the highest honorthis College
offers."
Assistant Professor of History Timothy Burke raised the concern at the meeting that the new format did not make him
any more confident that the students
signed up for his seminar would not have
to drop out of it at a later time because of
a scheduling conflict. Yet Warner believes "that problem is not going to be
solved by any [type of] seminar meet-

ing."
Warner emphasizes that the meeting
was an "experiment" and that he
is "definitely still listening for other
ideas" about resolving scheduling conflicts.

Provost Encourages Use of

Mid-Term Course Evaluations
By Erik Huneke
The Provost's Office notified all faculty members to consider offering their
students the opportunity to evaluate their
courses at the mid-point of the semester,
thus continuing an effort that began last
spring.

The notion of mid-term course evaluations sprang from student suggestions,
and theProvost's Office and the Division
Chairs agree that they are useful. Yet the
Provost's Office "will probably not try to
mandate the mid-term evaluations," according to Associate Provost Mark
Jacobs.
Jacobs explains that "some faculty
worried about brand-new faculty having
theirmorale in their first course damaged

in the middle [of it], rather than at the
end, with negative feedback." The
counter-argument would be that faculty
members might feel more comfortable if
they could adapt to students' concerns
about a course before it was over.
Professors who do not have "any written or graded material handed in at the
middle of the term," have also expressed
reservations about the evaluations. They
believe that an evaluation in such a situation would be "meaningless," according to Jacobs.
Given these mixed feelings, Jacobs
feels thebest possible position is to "point
out the goodthings about mid-term evaluations, say how important they [are] to
many of the students, and ask faculty to
try them."

Activist Rodriguez Widens
Horizons for Inner-City Youth
By Erik Huneke

Poet, artist, and activist Luis Rodriguez
delivered the first of three lectures in
CIVIC's "Voices from the Front" series
yesterday evening in the LP AC Cinema.
"Even though I do all this writing, it
really becomes a question of saving
people's lives," Rodriguez said. Drawing on his own experience as a former
gang member, he has helped young men
and women in an economically disadvantaged Chicago neighborhood to organize Youth Struggling for Survival, a
group originally comprised exclusively
of gang members. His son, now 20, has
been a member of theLatin Kings gang
for the past several years.
Rodriguez remarked this his son
viewed his gang friends as "family," that
he "was aiming for something beautiful,
buthe didn't know what that meant." He
felt it was important for his son, and other
youth, to realize "what [it says] about
your life" if you are willing to die for a
egg thrown or a dirty look.
The frequent allusions to royalty or
regal animals in the names of Latino
gangs in Chicago is a further sign for
Rodriguez that theirmembers are "striving for something noble, sovereign" and
because of such factors as family life,
schools, and the police, "they don'tknow
how to get there."
As a gang member, Rodriguez had
been "prepared to die for anything." By
the time he reached the age of eighteen,
twenty-five of his friends had already
died. He adopted the mentality of a soldier in a battlefieldwho wonders why so
many of his comrades have died and he
has been spared.
Thanks to the guidance of mentors,
Rodriguez learned thathe"needed to die
for something bigger, [that] battlescould
be won by not fighting them." Too often
in today's society, "young kids [still]
aren'tbeing taught this."
Eventually, Struggling for Survival
was expanded to include non-gang members, since most youth are not involved in
gangs even if they might have the same
frustrations that gang members have. All
of the young people yearn for the oppor-

tunity to make their voices heard.To this
end, the group has formed its own video
production company.
He does not "want to tell these kids
what to do...[or] impose [his] morality on
them." Instead, he views the process of
empowerment one in whichyoung people
"learn how to own their own lives."
Recently, Struggling for Survival held
a meeting of one-hundred fifty youth at
which Rodriguez was the "only adult
allowed to speak." The youth organized
the conference themselves without outside financial backing. During the conference, held in a housing project basement, there was ablack-out; when forced
to move to a different location, forty
more young men and women were drawn
to the gathering.
By making films and organizing peace
retreats in rural settings, the youngadults
in these communities do not just want to
air out theirproblems; they want to focus
on viable solutions. His son and a very
loyal member of a rival female gang,
Ninj a, have approached one anotherabout
creating peaceful terms between thenrival organizations.
Rodriguez feels that despite the economic upheaval caused by the move from
an industrial to a technological society,
technology can create "a world where
our dreams and imaginations" can be
fulfilled as long as itis widely accessible.
Yet he feels that society is still denying
youth necessary initiationrituals present
in the traditions tribal societies from all
parts of the world.
He feels that such an initiation process
must contain the following four elements:
a) a metaphorical death; b) community
involvement; c) setting aside of ego; and
d) a permanent change in the individual
which is recognized by others.
Instead, our society's alternative is to
construct more prisons according to the
Field of Dreams mantra: "If you build
them, they will come." Efforts have also
been underway to deport Latino gang
members to Latin American countries
like El Salvador. This latter phenomenon, which Rodriguez refers to as the
"internationalizationof gang culture," is
the subject of Rodriguez's next book.

It's time to be realistic about our Tri-College community
Last week, while shuffling through several
weeks' worthof mail that had accumulated in her
mailbox, a Swarthmore student began depositing
unwanted items into the recycling bin by the west
exit in Parrish. BMG CD order form...
STC services phone bi11... her mailbox mate's
personal mail... Tri-CollegeNews... MasterCard
application... CP&P announcements
"What are you doing?"fumed a student walking down the hall.
"Excuse me?" replied the Swattie.
"Why are you throwing that out?"
"Well I don'treally trust STC, and
"No, no, the Tri-Co News. Don't you read it?"
"No, what do I care about what's going on at
Haverford and Bryn Mawr?"
"Well, aren't you interested in the Tri-College
community?"
"Not really, what do you mean?"
"Well if it weren't for the Tri-Co partnership,
Swatties wouldn't be able to go to events, parties
and classes at the other two colleges."
"Big deal. In threeyears at Swat I've only been
to Bryn Mawr twice, and I've never even seen
Haverford."
"That's a typical attitude for a Swattie. You
should be ashamed of yourself."
"Oh come on, be honest. How many timeshave
you ever been to Haverford or Bryn Mawr?"
"I flm a Haverford student."
This sort of personal confrontation is not terribly common, however the sentiments expressed
by both students is fairly typical. Although we at
Swarthmore generally endup taking advantage of
the College's relationship with Haverford and
Bryn Mawr at some point, we tend to be pretty
apathetic about it Bi-College students sense this,
and they tend to get pretty tickedoff. While we do
appreciate the fact that we have two wonderful
schools as a valuable resource, we think that
maybe our counterparts in the Tri-College community should simply chill out
Last month. The Bi-College News ran a complaint under the headline "David [sic] Matthews
Concert Denied to Bryn Mawr and Haverford
Students." The article, which labelled Swarthmore students in attendance "a privileged group
of students," attackedS warthmore's lack ofeffort
in publicizing the September 24 performance to
Haverford and Bryn Mawr. Despite the fact that
SAC viewed this as a Swarthmore event and
simply focused its energies on including Swatties,
not excluding Bi-College students, the article suggested that Swarthmore had "breached the spirit
V
of the Tri-Co community."
The article failed to realize that Bi-College
itmiwti weren't invited simply because of an
overly high estimate of how many Swarthmore
students would attend. All of the information
available to SAC suggested that there might be a
shortage of tickets for all thosewho wished to go;
a Phoenix poll revealed that 68% of the student
body was interested. Eager Swatties waited in line
—"

hours in advance for tickets. Some students
even avoided getting tickets when they were first
distributed, because they assumed there would
not be enough tickets available. Given the assumption that 200 interested Swarthmore students would probably be excluded from the performance, what would have been the purpose of
advertising theDave Matthews show to Haverford
and Bryn Mawr?
The article also reasoned that Swarthmore was
unfairly practicing a double standard, because
"Swarthmore students are invited to participate in
Haverford's spring frolic." In response to this, one
Swarthmore student remarked "Well, I invited
Bill Clinton to my birthday party, but he didn't
invite me to his. I guess that means the President
is practicing a double standard."
The Bi-College News article was written with
the sense that when one of the three schools in the
Tri-College community hosts an event, the host
school should give the same consideration to the
other schools's students as it does its own. We at
The Phoenix simply don'tbuy that If Haverford
is lucky enough to get a U.S. Senator or a famous
author to speak, and there's only enough room for
Haverford students, fine. We don't see a problem
with each school giving its own students toptwo

priority.
What Haverford and Bryn Mawr tend to forget
is that in theTri-College community, Swarthmore
is the partner that asks the least, and yet receives
the most criticism. Inreality, the core of the intercollege community is the Bi-College partnership
between Haverford andßrynMawr. After all, you
don't see any "Bi-College" newsletters between
Swarthmore and Haverford, or Swarthmore and
Bryn Mawr. The other two schools also share
membership in numerous organizations, such as
the Bryn Mawr and Haverford gospel choir, debate club and women's teams inrugby, badminton
and Ultimate Frisbee. Swat is just too far away
from the other schools to be quite as involved in
the inter-college participation.
We're not complaining about this fact, we just
don't think that we shouldreceive so much criticism for our apathy. Bryn Mawr and Haverford
tend to use our resources far more than we use
eitherof theirs. A student working at McCabe told
The Phoenix that there are generally "twice as
many incoming [book] requests from Bryn Mawr
and Haverford as there are outgoing requests from
Swatties." While we tend to run into scores of
Bryn Mawr women at our Old Club and Paces
parties, we don't regularly send quite as many
students toBi-Co parties. In fact, according to this
week's Phoenix poll (seepiechart), 65% of Swarthmore students don't even attend one event at
either Bryn Mawr or Haverford over the course of
a given semester.
Having a Tri-College community is a wonderful thing. The summer Tri-Co program forfresh is
an excellent example of what can be accomplished when the three schools pool their resources. On balance, however, Swarthmore is
generally not an equal partner. This isn't a big deal
to us, it just explains why many of us tend to toss
our Tri-CollegeNews into recycling bins. And for
those still concerned that Swarthmore isn't sharing enough—we have a great new phone services
company to recommend to our Tri-Co friends.

Who Needs a Watch When You Have A Sun Dial?!
Pandora's Psychic Predictions
The Smashing Pumpkins Don't
Disappoint With Double Album
Cancer
*FOR ENTERTAINMENT
PURPOSES ONLY! BILLIONS
AND BILLIONS SERVED!

By Sean Ewen

"It was in the DNA," joked Billy
Corgan, lead singer of the alternative
rockbandThe Smashing Pumpkins, when
asked how hisband came up with theidea
of a double CD concept album. Luckily
for musicfans worldwide, genetic destiny
prevailed. The Smashing Pumpkins
released their long-awaited, double CD
set, "Mellon Collie and the Infinite
Sadness" on October 24th, bringing to an
end more than a year of hype and
speculation regarding one of the most
eagerly anticipated rock albums in recent
years.

And judging by the quality of the
album, the excitement was certainly
justified. The new album finds the
Smashing Pumpkins exploring their musical roots,resulting instyles
ranging from industrial to
techno to folk, whileremaining loyal to the dreamy, hardedged sound of their past
albums. The result is an
ambitious, multiform album
which will be remembered
as one of the best releases of
theyear, and possibly, of the
decade.
Following last summer's
tour
of
headlining
Lollapolooza, Billy Corgan
and friends returned to their
hometown of Chicago to
begin work on their double
CD concept album, which
Corgan has often talked of
becoming '"The Wall' of our generation", referring to the epic Pink Floyd
album of the late seventies. A remarkable sixty-five songs were generated in
less than a year for the album, most
writtenby Corgan, twenty eight of which
appear on "Mellon Collie and the Infinite
Sadness" (the Pumpkins willrelease some
of the other songs as b-sides). In the
recording of the album, the Pumpkins
decided to bypass the "overproduced"
sound of "Siamese Dream", their multiplatinum second album (preceded by their
1991 debut "Gish"), that, rumor has it,
found perfectionistBilly Corgan playing
all of the guitar and bass parts in the
studio under the direction of then producerßutchVig. This timearound, working with free-lance English techno producer, Rood, the Pumpkins recorded a
reasonable amount of the material in a
rehearsal space together as a band. The
result is a lively, energetic sound present
on many of the tracks on the album.
Remaining work was completed in the
studio, with the Pumpkins widely experimenting with sampling for the first time.
This experimentation reveals itself in the
percussion as well as backing music on
the album. A long, extracted dilemma
ensued during their recording sessions
when some demo tapes of the new material were stolen from the studio. This
delayed the release of the album significantly. TheSmashing Pumpkins pulled it
all together however, and finally, last
Tuesday, Virgin Records released their
much anticipated new album to the open
arms of music fans across the globe.
"Mellon Collie and the Infinite
Sadness" is separated into two discs, the

first entitled "Dawn to Dusk" and the
second, 'Twilight to Starlight." Billy
Corgan has said that the concept for the
two discsis "day and night":

the first "for
the day when you're rocking" and the
second for the night "to put you to sleep
at the end." When you first listen to
"Dawn to Dusk", you may wonder if
you're actually listening to the Smashing Pumpkins. The first track on the
album, "Mellon Collie and the Infinite
Sadness", titled after the name of the
album, is a threeminute piano solo pi ay ed
by Corgan and backed by orchestration.
The same theme is carried to the next
track, 'Tonight, Tonight," another orchestral masterpiece reminiscent of"Disarm" from "Siamese Dream." When you
listen to the powerful drumming and orchestration on 'Tonight, Tonight," you

know there is something special about
this album. The subsequent tracks,
"Jellybelly," "Zero," "Here is No Why,"
and the first single from the album, "Bullet with Butterfly Wings," find the Pump-

kins back at their traditional hand of
guitar driven rock, with some classicrock influences shining through on "Here
is No Why." Following these songs are
the dreamy 'To Forgive" and the angry,
driving "F**k You (An Ode to No One)."
Track nine, "Love", finds the Pumpkins experimenting with new sounds such
as techno rhythms, sampling, and distorted vocals. Very interesting. The next
song, "Cupid de Locke," poignantly reveals the diversity of the album, especially when placed right after "Love".
"Cupid de Locke" finds the Pumpkins
weaving yet another dreamy song, this
time using a harp (very cool effect) and
synthesized violins and xylophones. Itis
definitely unlike anything you haveheard
from the Pumpkins before, but then again,
you could say that about more than half
of the songs on the album. At the end of
the disc, The Smashing Pumpkins quiet it
down with the soft and beautiful
"Galapogos," the vocally forceful
"Muzzle," one of the best songs on the
album, the epic "Porcelina of the Vast
Oceans", which contrasts soft melodies
with heavy guitar and percussion, and the
quiet and enigmatic 'Take Me Down,"
the final song on disc one. This song
finds guitarist James Iha taking the lead
vocals, and the resulting sound is reminiscent of the Carpenters (yes, you read
that correctly). It certainly isn't the greatest song they've ever written, but it slowly
drifts you away from thefirst disc, "Dawn

Dusk."
The second disc, 'Twilight to Starlight," definitely has a different feeling
than the first. More diverse and experimental, the disc ranges from being downright freaky in places to relaxing and
comforting in others. Despite being heavy
at times, you will find yourself drifting
away at the end of the disc just as Corgan
intended. The disc begins with "Where
Boys Fear to Tread" and "Bodies," two
intense, almost haunting songs, music
not for the uninitiated. As a wailing
Corgan shouts "love is suicide" in
"Bodies," you may wantto run from your
dorm room in terror. If you wait for the
next track, however, you will find yourself on a dreamy high for the next three
songs: "Thirty-Three," "In the Arms of
Sleep," and "1979." Here we find the
Smashing Pumpkins at
their best, intertwining
beautiful melodies and
emotive lyrics. This is
probably my favorite section of the album.
The Pumpkins change
styles once again with
track six, "Tales of a
Scorched Earth." Reminiscent of Nine Inch
Nails, "Tales of a
Scorched Earth" is driving and violent and takes
many listens to get used
to, as we find the Pumpkins experimenting with
an "industrial" sound for
the first time. This track
is followed by 'Thru the Eyes of Ruby,"
another Smashing Pumpkins musical
masterpiece reminiscent of "Soma"from
"Siamese Dream," and "Stumbleine," a
melancholy acoustic solo played by
Corgan. Track nine, "X.Y.U," is the last
of the heavy songs on the album and is
another classic, hard-edged Smashing
Pumpkins song. The final five songs on
"Twilight to Starlight" are the most relaxing of the album, gently drifting the
listener away into a tranquil repose. The
experience is magical. Beginning with a
quirky "We Only Come Out at Night,"
the Pumpkins introduce soothing techno
rhythms on "Beautiful," peaceful folk
melodies on "Lily (My One and Only),"
and dreamy vocals and harmonies on
to

"By Starlight." The final song, "Fare-

well and Goodnight", a lullaby, finds
each member of the band taking the lead
vocals for a refrain. It is quite amazing.
By the end of this song, you will find
yourself in awe of The Smashing Pumpkins.
"Mellon Collie and the Infinite
Sadness" is an epic musical journeywhich
you will wantto take over and over. The
songs are diverse, powerful, and full of
emotion. The Smashing Pumpkins
definitely spent a lot of time working on
this album, both musically and lyrically,
and theresult is, in my opinion, one of the
best albums in recent years. I highly
recommend "Mellon Collie and the
Infinite Sadness." Although you may
have to give some of the songs time to
grow on you, you will not be disappointed.
TheSmashing Pumpkins, with this album,
have certainly established themselves as
one of the best groups of our time.

You Knew We Had To Do It: Top
20 Uses for Kohlberg Art Glass
By Sara Miller
Eric Walton
and Dan Sachar
Now, we allknow that there are a lot of
conflicting opinions on the new "art glass"
in Kohlberg Hall. When we first heard
that the new building was going to have
some decorative
stained-glass
windows, our spirits
soared. Images of the

"What a brilliant
idea" we thought, "to
use tasteful and pretty
glass to add character
to the new building."
As the workers advanced rapidly in
their progress we all
awaited eagerly for
the arrival of this
wonderfully tasteful
stained-glass. Dan
remembers the exact
moment he first saw
what is now referred
to as Art Glass. "I
was giving a tour
around campus," Dan
recounted hesitantly, "and when we
reached the part of between Kohlberg
and the LP AC I heard from the back of
the tour, 'What's that?!!?' Hooked up to
Kohlberg and I gave the only response I
could, 'To be honest, ma'am, I just don't
know.'"
Now, the threeof us thought the matter
through and realized thismay not be such
a bad thing. It comes down to the old
question, "Is the glass half-empty or halffull" and we choose to view it as half-full.
Sure, the colors are right out of "The
Brady Bunch Interior Decorating

Get Shorty: Sure It's Fun, But
Another Pulp Fiction? I Think Not
By John Derderian

Get Shorty (** 1/2) It seems that every where you turn in contemporary
American cinema the influence of
Quentin Tarantino is evident. A whole
crop of "Tarantinoids" have taken
HollyDerwood by storm: stylish,
postmodern auteurs specializing in gangsters, violence, and Machospeak (often
with a touch of black comedy). While
many of these filmmakers aspire to be
Reservoir Dogs, their efforts more often
resemble "pup fiction." A few
Tarantinoids have been able to add their
own ingredients to the master's formula
(Bryan Singer's The Usual Suspects and
Roger Avary's Killing Zoe), but usually
when Hollywood tries to franchise success they fail. Even though they may
reproduce all of the elements of that
success, the final product lacks thecharm
of the origrtial. Such is the case with Get
Shorty.
Shorty is a caper film which follows a
Miami loan shark named Chili Palmer
(John Travolta) who takes a side trip to
L.A. to do a little free-lance collections
work for a Vegas casino. The casino is
owed money by a B-movie producer
(Gene Hackman) in search of artistic
legitimacy. Chili, a true cineaste, is captivated by Hollywood, and he soon becomes a movie producer with a knack for

fundraising. His big challenge is to recruit megastar Martin Weir (Danny
DeVito) for his movie. Director Barry
Sonnenfeld (The Addams Family films)
pays close attention to the colorful
characterizations that crime novelist
Elmore Leonard had created in his book.
The film's bright, sunny texture as a
background to the noirish plot is a
foundation for the irony which exists in
heavy doses throughout the story.
Jazzmaster John Lurie's alternately cool
and hectic score faultlessly enlivens
screen action.
The performances are all top notch—

wonderful comic turns as bad guys trying
to help themselves to a spoonful of Chili's
action. Travolta's Chili is a restrained,

drug-free variation on his Vincent Vega
character from Pulp Fiction. Travolta is
so charismatic it is amazing to note that
less than two years ago he was veritably
unemployable in tinseltown.

involved for it not to be mildly entertain-

ing. Itdoes, however, lack the energy and
the complication to really engage the
audience. The film was born out of the
desire of Jersey Films (the same company that produced Pulp) to give the
audience what they had responded so
well to in the past. It was born from
Hollywood's mistaken notion that good
filmmaking is componential and formulaic. Shorty is so completely aTarantino
film that it is amazing to note that he

neither wrote, directed, nor produced it
(he didn't even adorn it with one of his
cute little cameos). Many aspects of the

film are connected to Tarantino's previous work: Sonnenfeld was the cinematographer for Blood Simple, a known
influence on Tarantino; Tarantino has
spoken repeatedly about adapting one of
Leonard's stories; the verbal and visual
references to "old Hollywood" (Welles
and Hawks); and most of all, the presence of Travolta.
The fact that the film it an
amalgamation ofTarantino qualities contributes to the unspectacular final product. The lack of originality ultimately
dooms this misbegotten progect. In short.
Get Shorty is mediocre when compared
to similar works. Robert Altman's The
Player has more bite as a satire of the
dog-eat-dog world of Hollywood,
Tarantino is better at Tarantino, and if
you really want to get into an Elmore
Leonard yam, read thebook. [Get Shorty

Empty the Shelters to Stage Sleep-A-Thon
By Jessica Fisher

Philadelphia, yet for some reason city
beau tific at ion takes precedence over finding housing for those who are currently
without a roof over their heads.
These are theprimary issues addressed
by the Kensington Welfare Rights Union
(KWRU), an organization of homeless
people demonstrating their need for affordable housing. Due to an inordinant
numberof requests for aid latelast spring,
members of KWRU decided to set up
what has been called Tent City. Established just after Independence Day, Tent
City is a racially diverse group of about
thirty homeless families who took over
an empty lot in Kensington, one of
Philadelphia's poorest neighborhoods.
First located at Berks St. and American

in 1865, was one of ten Catholic churches
in North Philadelphia to be closed in
1993 despite the protests of neighborhood residents and parishioners. Since
their move into the church more than a
month ago, the families, together with
other KWRU members and supporters

Carl: Kate, I'm Batman.
Kate: Ummmmm... whatever, get on
with thereview.
Carl: OK, OK. Friday night's movie is
yet another recently releasedblockbuster.
Batman Forever, starring Val Kilmer,
Tommy Lee Jones, Jim Carrey, Nicole
Kidman, and Chris O'Donnell. In the
third of the recent series ofBatman films
based on the DC comics star, we have a
brand new Batman/Bruce Wayne
(Kilmer) and finally get to see Robin/
Dick Grayson (O'Donnell). I'll try to
give you a synopsis of the main characters. VillainTwo-Face (Jones) was District Attorney Harvey Dent before he was
disfigured in a courtroom accident, and
now wreaks havoc in Gotham City because heblames Batmanfor the accident.
Obsessed withmillionaireBruce Wayne's
success, Edward Nigma (Carrey) was a
disgruntled inventor working for
Wayne Enterprises. After having
his ideas denied by the millionaire
himself, Nigma becomes The
Riddler, trying to use his riddles and
sophisticated inventions to show his
superiority to Wayne and Batman.
But it doesn't stop there. Dick
Grayson was an acrobat until a circus accident claimedthe lives of his
family. Swearing vengeance, he's
taken in by Wayne. Finally, Chase
Meridian (Kidman) is the beautiful
abnormal psychologist who helps
Wayne withhis nightmares and falls
in love with the millionaireand his
alter ego. The film has the usual
"super hero" story with plenty of action
and special effects, and Jim Carrey is his
typical amazingly funny, wacky self, but
having all this blockbuster stuff in one
film ends up causing some problems.
Like the second Batman film (Batman
Returns), where Batman also faced two
super villains, too much of the film ends
up being spent trying to develop thecharacters, and then having a final showdown. With the added task ofdeveloping
Meridian and Grayson/Robin, and even
Bruce Wayne, you end up with fantastic
looking, poorly developed characters with
lots of explosions and little story. Kilmer
ends up being a better Batman than
Michael Keaton, but not as good a Bruce
Wayne. In general, I liked this film better
thanBatman Returns, but not as much as
Batman. They should really go with
fewer super villains per movie. And I'm

Tonight's Balinese Music and Dance
Performance to be a Family Affair
By GiridharSrinivasan

VsWARTHMOREv/
By Stephanie Wang
These items were taken

from The

Phoenix on November 5,1929.

The SAT had been used as a requirement for admission to Swarthmore on an experimental basis
for the past three years. The College stated that students who do
poorly on the test rarely do well at
the College.
The practice of "hazing" the freshman class by the sophomores in
order to enforcethe freshmen rules
was endedby a student vote. Physical intimidation devices such as
"low bridging" and "rides" were
abolished. In the future, freshmen
rules would be enforced by the
student government.
$20,000 was paid to the college for
land taken for construction of an
underpass at therailroad station. In
the past, some injuries and one
death had occurred at the crossing.
The firm of Karcher and Smith,
architects of the men's fraternity
lodges, was presented an award at
the Philadelphia Chapter of the
American Institute of Architects.
In thepast, thereading of announcements in the dining room during
meal times had worked out well.
However, in 1929 the announcers
were "men whose lung capacity is
limited and who at the zenith of
their announcing careers and with
every vocal muscle straining at the
leash are barely able to produce a
whisper."

World-renowned Balinese musician/
composer/dancer I Wayan Rai will perform tonight at 8:00 in the Lang Performing Arts Center. He will be accompanied
by his wife I Gusti Srinatih, a dancerand
vocalist. Their two young children, Degus
and Indra, age ten and twelve respectively, will perform with them.
Wayan Rai is a well-known music
expert from the village of Übud in the
island ofBali. His presentation will take
the form of performance cum lecture,
which will help the general audience
appreciate and understandthe music and
tradition whichunderlies the fantastic art
ofBalinese music. Wayan Rai will teach
a class atSwarthmore next semester which
will be open to all membersof the student
body, and all participants will perform a
concert at the end of the spring.
Professor Tom Whitman 'B2, an expert on Balinese music and co-coordinator of the event, described the music as
being "a wonderful mass ofbell sounds,
which has a complex texture, and is yet,
in a funny sort of way, very simple." The
music form originated on the island of
Bali, in Indonesia. A similar form of
music is also native to the island of Java.
Closely related to Balinese dance and
religion, Balinese music is at the core of
theBalinese village tradition. "Each village has its own distinct style, which
lends the island a tremendous amount of
diversity," said Whitman. The Balinese
gamelan, or orchestra, consists of bells,
gongs, drums, and flutes which are made
out of bamboo. "All the instruments are
made by villagers and what is really
amazing is that no two villages even have
the same make and design of instruments," said Whitman. Balinese music is
also closely tied in with the religious and
social tradition of the Balinese people.
Whitman said that what makes it wonderful is that "each village has its own
style and the people of Bali take tremendous pride in their regional diversity."

Whitman said that Balinese dance is
an essential part of the musical tradition.
He said that the dance style is "very
refined and active, and the facial expressions of the eyes, fingers, and even the
toes are vivid and stark." Wayan Rai's
children will be performing two of the
most difficult pieces in the Balinese dance
tradition.
Wayan Rai himself is a distinguished
player who started out with his wife as
lecturer in the Government Conservatory at Bali, called the STSI. He also
taught music in his native village of Übud,
and later went on to study Indian percussion instruments at San Diego State University. Wayan Rai extracts aspects of
the Indian tradition to incorporate into
the Balinese tradition. He is currently a
Professor of Ethnomusicology at the

University of Maryland.
Whitman studied music traditions in
Bali after he graduated from Swarthmore. He specializes inethnomusicology
at Swarthmore and will be playing at the
concert tonightalong withDanielle Anctil
'97, an Ethnomusicology student at Swarthmore. Anctil played a smallpiece with
Wayan Rai and Whitman at a concert
which was held recently at Haverford.
She described performing with Wayan
Rai as an "incredible experience." Anctil
said she is very excited to be playing at
Swarthmore and was full of admiration
and praise for Wayan Rai. She said that
"he takes the time to explain things to
people" and added that "the children are
simply fantastic." Anctil said, "it's going
to be a wonderful performance, but a
very nerve-wracking one for me."

coolest guy in town, her attempt to avoid
the advances of The Geek (skillfully
played by Anthony Michael Hall, who
reprised theroll in just about every subsequent John Hughes film), and the visiting wacky foreign exchange student
Long Duk Dong, played by Gedde
Watanabe. It's pretty easy to tell that the
PC movement had not yet begun when
this movie was shot, as Dong is easily
one of the most offensive characterizations of an Asian male in recent Him
history. Don't say you weren't warned.
Since the 1980's are the nostalgia yean
for our generation, it's hard for lateteens/early twenty-somethings to avoid
being entertained by a blast from the past
like Sixteen Candles. The soundtrack
alone is worth your time. And I'd honestly say that the most fun I've ever had
at a Swat movie was when they showed
the eighties classicFast Times at
Ridgemont High two years ago.
I'd bet my Rubik's Cube thatthis
will be a similarly good time.
Carl: Yeah that Long Duk

hey, what do you want; Sixteen
Candlesis your classic 80's John
Hughes film. It's fun. If you
haven't seen it yet, it's definitely
worth a couple of hours this Saturday night. And if you have,
well the film has some great lines
and scenes that make it worth
seeing again. Again, not a great
film, but a fun one. I guess my
only question is whether or not

Batman deserves a bowl of oatmeal with
way too much water, and way too few
oats. Kate declines from giving it the
tempting New Coke Award, because new
and different isn't necessarily bad, and
instead gives it a straight-up bowl of oats
for being a genuinely entertaining couple
of hours. Kate and Carl both agree that
Sixteen Candles is worth a bowl of those
classic oats you used to have when you
were a kid. You know, with brown sugar

Schumacher adds a few new thematic
elements to the movie that may take traditional Batman fans by surprise.
Schumacher is known for his tendency to
include substantial homoerotic material
in his films, and this is no exception I
thinkhe pulls it off well, but I've heard a
lot of complaints. Once again, if you
were really into the old characters and
characterizations, you'll bemissing them,
but since I was never that attached in the
beginning, it didn't bother me at all.
I'd have to agree with Carl that the
attempt to develop so many characters
played by so many prominent actors and
actresses was really the film's downfall,
but t enjoyed seeing the more slapstick
portrayals. Jim Carrey is as psychotic as
ever, but goes a bit overboard in my
opinion. Tommy Lee Jones is good, but
his Two Face isn't really so two-faced.

And yes, Kilmer's Batman is a little too
similar to his Bruce Wayne, but I think it
could be argued that this is justified by
the plot developments in the film. Look
for Drew Barrymore in a minorrole. It's
nowhere near her performance as Gertie
in E.T., but then, what is? Lastly, I reaily
missed Danny Elfman's musical score
(one of the highlights of the first two
films), but I suppose it was a trade-offfor
getting makeup artist and creature creator Rick Baker to do the special effects.
The audio folks went wild with the digital sound mastering. Not that we'll notice it here, but seeing the film at

The women's basketball team hasbeen
working hard for the past two weeks in
preparation for first scrimmage against
Beaver College on Monday, November
6 at 7:30.
Coaches Davis, Emanuel, Maravalli,
and Schaefer are working extremely hard
to get the team ready for the big season
it faces. Each day they assist the team
members with individual improvement
programs which give the women extra
help in their areas of weakness. These
programs are specifically designed for
each person to progress at her own speed
according to her own abilities. Team
practices consist of conditioning workouts and game strategies.
Building up stamina and leg strength
are two things the team works toward to
get into shape for the upcoming games.
The women also practice offenses and
defenses, fast breaks and presses, shooting and ball handling.
All together, the team will play a tough
schedule of 24 games against talented
teams from nearby colleges as well as
from Cal Tech and Whittier of California. Support from enthusiastic and loyal
friends will help to spark the team and
bring home wins.
Tough practices and much preparation are helping to ready the women for
this event They now eagerly await this
first chance to play and see how they
match up against the competition. Following the Beaver College scrimmage,
there will be another preseason game on
Wednesday, November 8, at 7:30, at
home versus Widener.
After that, the women will have two
more weeks of practice until the beginning of the regular season on November
21 when they play at Johns Hopkins
University. The homeopener will be the
following Tuesday, November28, at7:30
against Washington College. Fans are
strongly encourged to come and cheer
on the GarnetTide as they capture their
first home-court victory.
Determination and perseverance are
important keys to this *95-'96 season.
With only 5 team members returning
from last year, and a team of only 11
women, there is much worknecessary in
order to have a successful season. So far,
the women have proven to be committed

Swarthmore's men's basketball program had one of its most successful
recruiting classes this year. Five freshmen recruits and one freshman walk-on
have bolstered the ranks of the Garnet.
Although they are hard-pressed to earn
varsityplaying time on a team thatboasts
11 noperclassmen, they are the foundation of a team expecting to go far this
year.
DarbyKopp '99 and Tim Scofield '99
join the team at guard. Kopp attended the
same high school as another Garnet
guard, Chad Brown '97. Last year Kopp
ledhis teamto the Western MaineChampionship.
Scofield describes himself as a
"shooter and a slasher" and has the talent
to carry a large share of the offensive
burden in the future. Rounding out the
new guards is J.P. Harris, who will join
the team at theconclusion of thefootball
season.
Forward J.J. Purdy, hailing fromSanta
Barbara, CA, is the only new member of
the team form outside the Northeast region.
Having recently finishedhis first soccer season, forward Mike Schall '99 will
join his brother Ben '97 in the Garnet
ranks. The younger Schall led his high
school team to the South Jersey Finals.
Naveen Nirgudkar '99 shows enough
promise to be accepted as the only walkon this year. "The captains [Matt
Grossman '96 and Craig Rodner '96]
have done a great job," he said. "They

conference race, Swarthmore men's crosscountry ran to a fourth place finish behind
Haverford, Gettysburg, and Franklin &

MarshallColleges at the Centennial Conference Championships at RoseTreePark
in Media last Saturday.
But if this season follows last year's
trajectory, the men's team can take heart
from this performance: Kerry Boeye '97
(9th) and Scott Reents '96 (14th) established a presence for Swarthmore in the
top pack of runners, while JohnFreeman
'96, Duncan Kirkpatrick '99, and Brenn
Jones '96 showed that Coach Dixon's
taper plan ought to put them in contention
with Gettysburg's top five scorers.
Swarthmore's top runners' performances inspire hope for next week's regional meet by displaying a focused attack on Gettysburg and Franklin &
Marshall's highest scoring runners.
As predicted by teammates and the
coach, Boeye proved that he is ready to
run with the top runners ofthe region such
as Haverford's lan Frasier and
Gettysburg's Bill Gray.
Boeye predicted a marked improvement for the team at the Regional Meet:
"We didn't do as well as we expected.
But as with last year, Gettysburg and
F&M peaked for this meet, and we will
fare far better against them next week."
And if Reents approaches top form,
this indeed might happen. Although
hobbledby a painful strain oflower back
muscles,

Reents ran most of the race in the top
finished just behind of Boeye on
Rose Tree's muddied course. The unstable terrain, riddled by four races earlier
that morning, made Reents come-back
especially painful.
But as teammateFreeman said, "Scott's
as tough as they come and I imagine he'll
diebeforehe gives an inch to anyone next
week."

And pain is something Swarthmore
has learned to live with this year. Ted
Dixon hopes his cutting edge, Carolina
taper will provide weary legs a relief and
catapult Swarthmore into the thick of the
national berth dog fight
Last year Dixon discovered the taper
plan in an athletic journal; entitled Carolina Crusin,' it was designedprimarily for
sprinters, but Dixon adapted it to a distance runner's program. The taper rests
runners by reducing overall mileage yet
hones their neuromuscular system with
practice consisting of 400 yard repeats at
race pace.
According to this logic, the men will
become more familiar with race pace then
ever beforeand feel comfortable running
at a pace that will secure a nationals bid.
Last year the taper worked famously.
Graham Lucks ran a whopping 30 seconds faster than hehad on the course, and
Freeman ran a personal record in spite of
running four and a halfmiles without his
left shoe.
Cameron Warner '97 was overheard
expounding the merits of the taper last
week after tapering for Saturday's race:
"God, I'm running 30 miles a week and I
felt like a monster out there. I can't
imagine what's going to happen when
you guys get out thereafter running 60-70
miles a week all year."
S warthmore's 3-7 runners response will
be key to the team's success next week.
While Freeman and Lucks have tapered
to great success last year, Jones and
Kirkpatrick are yet unproven on Carolina
Cruisin.'
If these men can close the gap between
them and Boeye and Reents, the men will
likely be there to challenge contenders
Gettysburg, Franklin & Marshall,
Moravian, and CarnegieMellonColleges.
With a year of pain and long runs behind
them, the men will step to the line at
Dickinson College on November 11 with
a lot of physical and emotional momentum.

"We spent the first week with general

Following an invitational tournament
on December 9, the team will begin its
regular season with an away match

The Garnet Tide fired up the war
wagon and traveled out to Lancaster to
take on Franklin & Marshall in an important Centennial Conference matchup
lastSaturday afternoon. Both teamsneeding a win to keep their slim championship hopes alive.
The Garnet Tide's season has been a
roller coaster, and Karl Miran's troops
were looking to stay on the high cycle
after last week's victory over Dickinson.
Instead, the Garnet Tide came crashing
to the ground with a resounding thud as
the Diplomats used a first half blitzkrieg
to blast the GarnetTide 42-22, in frontof
a Homecoming and Parent's Day crowd
of 3,500 at Williamson Field.
The rain thathas followed the Garnet
Tide all season subsided early Saturday
morning, and the sun even appeared by
kickoff. The beautiful weather was the
only pleasant aspect of the first half.
After one possession that crossed
midfield and then went backwards, the
Franklin & Marshall air show began, to
the delight of the Diplomat faithful. Beau
Eckert carved up the Swarthmore secondary like a Thanksgiving turkey, completing 13 of 19passes for 198 yards and
three touchdowns.
WhenEckert wasn't orchestrating the
airraid, he was directing the Diplomat's
ground game, which accounted for 122
yards and three more touchdowns, in-

Eckert. All told, the Diplomats scored
touchdowns on their first six possessions
and amassed 320 yards of total offense.
Combine that with the offense's pathetic 30 yards of total offense and two
turnovers and it's not difficult to see how
the Garnet Tide dug themselves into a 420 hole.

Swarthmore wrestling looks to improve
markedly this season with a great deal of
energy and the addition of eight new
bodies: six freshman, one sophomore,
and one senior. The team lost only two
seniors last year. Captains Chaz Teplin
'96, Alec Stall '9B, Pete Balvanz '9B, Jon
Fiorello '9B, and Tirian Mink '9B headline the bout sheets.
A major reason the Matmen maintain
their early season enthusiasm is the prospect of filling all ten weight classes
something they have been unable to accomplish in the past few years.
Without a doubt, the lower weights
will be the source of strength for the
Matmen as more than half the team fails
to tip the scales above ISO.

although numerous tournamentsremain.

The most recent college in the league
to have dropped its badminton program
was Rosemont, one and a half years ago.
Sears commented that there is some
promise for the development of new
teams, possibly even at Kutztown and
M illersv ille, which wouldbe convenient
competitors for Swarthmore's conference.
"With theOlympics coming up, people
will be watching badminton," Sears
noted. "We're looking for an explosion

The women's badminton season is

of Saturday prove that the team is right
on track to bust a move at the Regional
Championship meet at Dickinson High
School in two weeks.
After a long, hard season, the Garnet
Tide is ready to strut their stuff at the
regional meet. Now, in order to do this
and maximize peak performance at the
same time. Coach Ted's infamous topsecret taper program will be implemented.
Known to the select few as "Carolina
Cruisin'", this taper schedule is guaranteed to sharpen any runner into a worldclass athlete. Therefore, by the transitive rule of running, its likely to elevate
the Lady Amazons to the level of the
gods, bestowing upon them the swiftness of Hermes.

Men's Soccer
Finishes Season,

Disappointing
Loss to Rival
Haverford, 0-1
By Anne Frankenfleld
The rain stopped and the sun came out
over the soccer field at Haverford College where the Garnetmen's soccer team
prepared to take on their rival team on
Saturday, October 28. The starting lineup was announced and the game began.
The men played a tough game, with
Swat dominating for about half of the
first 45 minutes of play. Swarthmore,
stillplaying without top scorer LenCuello
'96, had several shots on goal but failed
to score. The game remained scoreless

It was a tough game,
and it could have
gone either way.
Both teams played
well.

SEASON WRAP-UPS

Ultimate Season Ends With a Formal Flourish

Men's and Women's Ultimate Teams play together in a costumed, co-ed tournament in Jersey
Vy The Ultimate Teams
The following article was written
collaboratively by themen'sand women's
Ultimate teams after their co-ed tournament on Saturday. The New Jersey tournament was the last of the season for the
Earthworms and the Watr Mothers.
Captain Lena Loewenthal '97 promised that there will be pick-up games a
few days a week and that the spring
season will start as soon as weather
permits. For the timebeing, however, the
Ultimate season has ended.
On Saturday, members of a co-ed
S wartmore frisbee team reached out all

160fingers for pure ultimate. The Smart
Whores, a hybrid of the Earthworms and
the War Mothers, displayed their team
spirit by wearing remarkably crafted
Halloween costumes ranging from an
eggplant (TobieBarton, '99) to abananahomed deer (Gabe Ross, '96).
Despite the swamp-like conditions that
prevailed on theLump's Pond State Park,
the team put in tremendousefforts against
Unversity of Delaware, University of
Maryland, JohnsHopkins, and Haverford.
"I liked the University ofDelaware game
the best," said obvious freshman Noam
Unger, "because they had a guy named
Spider, and I like spiders."

Junior co-captain Dave "slick as an
otter"Lewis turned his usually fish belly
whitebody into a glistening, mud-soaked,
streaking mass in his various and sundry
lay out bids for the cause.
After three losses, spirits and energy
were down, but a face-off with long-time

rivals and friends Haverford Lemmings,
together with reiforcementof pizza and a
giant sub sandwich brought the Smart
Whore spirit back for the closing game of
the tournament.
Despite the loss to the Lemmings, the
Smart Whores kept their spirit, even with
mud soaking in their cleats, nothing to do

with the yet-to-be-awarded Best Spirit
trophy. Freshman Mac "Space Cadet"
Funk caught a few passes in the end zone
by laying out in mud puddles. One of
those passes was thrown by co-captain
Lena Loewenthal, '97 about which Mac
said comily, "I like it when women huck
dirty to me."
While playing conditions were less
than ideal, the Smart Whores admitted
that circumstances could have been
worse. In reference to the misfortune of
their first opponent, Risharde Funches,
'97 wisely pointed out, "Well, at least we
didn't lay out in a terd."

throughout the first half.

The second half was played much
likethe first. Several shots were made by
the Swat offense but they were unable to
finish. The defense, led by Senior Jesse
Murphy, played impressively with several great saves by goalie Will Dulaney
'97.
By the middle of the second half,
thegame had become very intense and
physical both teams fighting for a goal
with yellow cards flying. "It was a tough
game," stated Kyle Barnett '97, "and it
could have gone either way. Both teams
played well."
Unfortunately, Haverford came
through with a goal in the remaining ten
minutes of play. Swarthmore knew they
had to get a goal but the time was short.
The team fought back hard making several close shots, but were unable to score.
The game ended in a 1-0 Haverford win.
This gamemarked theclose of another
season for most of the players, and now
they look forward to next year. For
Senior tri-captains, Len Cuello, Derek
Johnson, and Jesse Murphy, the game
marked the finish of their Swarthmore
playing careers. Unfortunate for Derek
and Len, their season ended with injury;
however, their time playing was exceptional.
Murphy reflects on the past couple of
months, "This season was one of the
most fun I've had at Swarthmore. We
had a great bunch of guys who were
exciting to play with and a pleasure to
know and hang out with. My only regret
about the season is that our other two
Senior captains, Lenny and Derek, didn't
get to finish the season playing with the
team. All in all, though, it was a fantastic
season!" Congratulations to the men's
team on their 10-9 winning season.

On Saturday, the Swarthmore
Women's Soccer Team played the longawaited match against Haverford, defeated last year by the Garnet
The women were unable to find sufficient momentum in the beginning of the
game, a frustrating trend throughout the
season. Haverford scored three goals in
the first fifteen minutes, and the Garnet
was left to play catch-up for therest of the
game.

After

a

consistent battle which held

the Fords scoreless for the rest of the
game, Swarthmore was unable to come

back and Haverford won the game 0-3,
sealing theirtitle as Conference Champions.

Needless to say, such
a close and hardfought game was a
disappointing end to a
difficult season for
the women's soccer
team. The experience
gained by the frosh
should serve the program well in the seasons to come.

The men's and women's Ultimate teams joined
forces to slosh it out in a messy New Jersey tournament.
This was the last official play of their fall season. The co-ed
team, cleverly knick-named the Smart Whores, donned craz\
costumes and took the field.
Although, the athletes did not have much success in
terms of scoring points, they came home feeling very bonded
as a team and proud of their accomplishments this season.
Not to mention the fact that they had a great time in the
tournament and throughout the season.

Buzzards Crush Villanova to Wind up Season Amar's Football Picks
Return

ofkey players raises level of ruggers' play to salvage winning season for Swarthmore

By Tony Sturm
The Evil Buzzards closed out their
season in style on Saturday. The men's
rugby team blew out Villanova to keep
the squad from having its first losing
season in a long time.
For the third straight week, the
Swarthmore men's rugby team went into
a game knowing that they would be extremely muddy and wet coming out. But
Swarthmore went into this game knowing something else. They knew that they
were going to dominate the Villanova
squad.

Swarthmore scored eight tries and limited Villanova to a single penalty kick as
they thoroughly whipped the visitors,
50-3.
For the first time this season, the Evil
Buzzards had their complete tight five
healthy. Every forward who played was
a natural forward, and accustomed to his
position. The team was ready to push
Villanova all over the field.
The rain that fell all Friday night was
kind enough to stop early Saturday morning, and the team was thankful for the
sunny sky that greeted them as they took
the field. The rain had stopped, but the
wetness remained, so the field was once
again in premium playing conditions:
muddy and sloppy.
Hooker Chris"Slo" Jahnke '9B started
out the scoring early. Jason Dougal '96
ran a quick penalty play and passed the
ball to Jahnke, who ran itinto the try zone
from five meters out It was Jahnke's
first try ofhis career. Back CaptainChaz
Teplin '96 kicked the conversion. Teplin
added four more later in the game, making some great kicks from very hard
angles.
The forward pack, with almost everybody healthy and back from vacation,
was again dominant, and Villanova was
constantly finding themselves getting
pushed away from theball. Theforwards
lost so few rucks that it was surprising
when Villanova won theball. "Our support was so good," said Dougal, after
viewing a tape of the game. "It was just
awesome to watch."
"Our team played for thefirst timethis
year as a cohesive unit, because we had
allof our best players on the field," noted

Tom Hooper '9€, —on making the tackle In Vie above picture, played his last rugby game against Villanova, as Swarthmore's
ruggers crushed their opposition SO3. The team left the field muddy, weary, but triumphant, and grateful or a winning season.

Dan Barrick '9B.
Barrick and the rest of the backs had a
rather easy game. The forwards were so
dominating, led by a solid second row of
Jim Tracy '97 and Bryce Walker '97, that
there was little needfor the ball to ever be
thrown out to the backs. Tracy was
playing in only his second game back
after recovering from a sore knee, and
showed thathe hadn't lost a step.
Most of the time, the ball was just
rolled out of a maul and posted for a ruck
or re-set for another maul by the forwards. Loose forwards Eric Ellingson
'96 and Dougal played solidly, rucking
like madmen and stuffing Villanova's
forwards every time they touched the
ball, which was notoften. Eight man Dan
Schwan '97 also played excellently, consistently rucking over the ball as one of
the first ruggers to the play.
The scrums also looked prettier than
they had all year, with JoeKhan '97 and

Captain, and soccer force in her own right, Robin Canada '96 commented,
"A senior on the team and a three year player, Mara is the absolute core of the
defense as both a player and a leader on the field. In counties games, she has
fostered team morale by her strong and consistent play."
Now that her socer career has ended at Swarthmore, she will take a brief
hiatus from sports and rest up for rugby in the spring. Willard's awesome
athletic abilty makes her a powerhouse in whatever sport she chooses to play.
