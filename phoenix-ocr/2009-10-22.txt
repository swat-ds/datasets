Shown above is Whittier Place at night. The campus walk checked for lighting deficiencies around campus.

BY MINH-DUYEN NGUYEN
mnguyen4@swarthmore.edu

Student Council hosted a safety
walk Monday to pinpoint areas on campus that need more lighting. The walk
was part of a continued initiative by
the council and the Swarthmore administration to increase student safety on
campus. There will also be a new officer on patrol by foot overnight, in
response to recent safety concerns.
Student Council Vice President Nate
Erskine
'lO and Campus Life
Representative Omari Scott 'l2 attended the walk with Vice President of
Facilities and Services Stu Hain,
Director of Public Safety Owen
Redgrave
and
Swarthmore
Maintenance Manager Bill Maguire.
The areas that will be receiving new
light fixtures include the tunnel pathway leading to Mary Lyon, the pathways leading up to Wharton, the athletics complex, the Women's Resource
Center, and the pathway between
McCabe Library and Willets. While
new light fixtures will be added in
some areas of campus, much of the
inadequate lighting is a result of
burned out or dimmed light bulbs.
Public Safety regularly checks for
burned out light fixtures, but Hain suggested that students should report any
burned out fixtures they see.
Student Council has made campus
safety a key focus in its agenda this
year. In its past meetings, Student
Council started discussions about campus safety with the Swarthmore administration and with the DART and
SMART teams. A large part of this discussion involved the issue of inadequate lighting on campus.
"There have been several students
that have come up to us and expressed
concern about how there are parts of
campus that aren't well lit," Erskine
said.
The safety walk used to occur annually, but has not occurred in the past
few years.
"This [safety walk] came out of a
general discussion about campus safety

that started probably more intensely
last spring with a couple instances that
happened on campus," Hain said.
The first incident involved a visiting
student from Villanova University who
was accosted by an allegedly armed
attacker. The second incident involved
a Wharton resident who found a potentially armed attacker hiding in her
room.
These incidents are the first incidents on the Swarthmore campus
involving an implied weapon "in over
ten years," according to Redgrave.

Student Council and the administration hope that the increased lighting
will act as a deterrent for would-be
attackers and enable students to be
more aware of their surroundings. ,
"The lights will allow you to see people approaching you and might allow
you to identify people and see what's
going on," Hain said. "That's certainly
a major piece of it. It's probably not as
comfortable for a person to do something to you if there is light and you're
out in the open."
The well-lit areas will center on
pathways between academic buildings
and dorms.
"The idea is to try and concentrate
light in walkways and work to get people to walk where the light is, not the
other way around," Hain said. "The
intention is to light the pathways all
the way up to the dorms but not flood
the dorms with lights unless there is a
huge cry for that. The intention has
never been to put so many lights up
around the dorms that you have to
close your blinds."
However, Redgrave warns that
crimes occur in both well-lit and dark
areas. Hain, Redgrave, and Maguire
worry that with more lighting, students will no longer be on their guard
against possible attackers. While lighting, to a degree, does increase campus
safety, it should not be an assurance of
safety.

"There aren't statistics on how lighting affects crime behavior," Redgrave
said. "There seems to be too many variables in there to draw any real conclu-

October 22, 2009

sions. Most people would agree that
adequate lighting is necessary. But

there are studies that many more candlepower [levels of light intensity] has
no major effect, it gives the perception
that people are more safe and causes
them to drop their defenses."
The incident involving the allegedly
armed gunman illustrates the inadequacy of lighting as a deterrent to
crime. The attacker followed the student down a well-lit path, though he
only accosted the student after they
entered the unlit grass strip between
Mertz and Alice Paul.
In addition to increased lighting on
campus, Hain and Redgrave also discussed improving on-campus patrols.
"We are changing the way we patrol
the campus at night," Hain said. "There
is a person that now patrols the campus
at night. We have a contract to have a
person here at night we didn't have
before. He will be the eyes and ears on
campus, walking campus with a radio.
Walking, not in a vehicle, so he will be
a foot patrol."
The patrol will be staffed using a
service that provides security for many
nearby campuses and will report to
Public Safety. Redgrave and Hain
believe that a foot patrol is necessary
and will be an improvement to campus
safety because Public Safety is unable
to patrol the interior of the campus
with a vehicle. The patrol will be working from 8 p.m. to 4 a.m. or from 9 p.m.
to 3:30 a.m.
Despite these changes, the most
important aspect of the security initiative has been encouraging students to
be on guard.
Student Council and the administration continue to encourage students to
program Public Safety's number into
their phones and discourage door propping in dorms.
"We are hoping we can change student behavior," Hain said. "We are hoping to make a big difference in that."
Students with further concerns or
suggestions about areas on campus
that have insufficient lighting should
contact Student Council or Stu Hain.

Since the college's endowment is

year,
the Ad Hoc Financial

new program that will either cut or
find other funds for $8 million annually.

Two weeks ago, the lack of student input became a concern at a
fireside chat about the college's
finances.
It was then proposed that the college should establish a student advisory group to aid the Ad Hoc
Financial Planning Group in the
formation of the $8 million plan.
"The way that money mediates
who comes to Swarthmore and what
type of community Swarthmore
becomes is something we should all
care about," Student Financial
Policy
Representative
Daniel
Symonds 'll said after the meeting.
Erskine added that though the
panel will present students' opinions to the Ad Hoc Financial
Planning Group, the Ad Hoc
Financial Planning Group will not
give the panel confidential information, such as salaries of the faculty
and department budgets. The group
cannot allow any students access to
that information. Nevertheless, the
student panel will be able to give
advice on topics directly affecting
the students.
Erskine said that in cases where
the council is debating student
budget cut options, he would like
the panel to communicate with the
student body to determine the
things that students value the most.
"We'll do it in a way so that all
Swarthmore students can know
about it and all Swarthmore students will be able to give their
input," Erskine said.
The group currently consists of
Student Council President Rachel
Bell 'lO, Erskine, Kevin Kim 'll
Robert Manduca 'lO, Symonds and
Student Budget Committee manager Simon Zhu 'IL
Two remaining spots were
opened to the student body. Over
fall break,
Student Council
Appointments Chair Jacqueline
Bailey-Ross 'l2 offered an application for these positions in an e-mail.

The application asked questions
such as, "What sort of role can you
envision for yourself in establishing
a better dialogue on finances
between students and administrators?" and "As a representative of
the student body, how do you see
your role on this committee?"
Bailey-Ross said that Bell and the
student council appointments committee then interviewed applicants.
"After the interviews, the committee will discuss and debate until
we reach a consensus," Bailey-Ross
said. "We use the application, interview, past experience, other obligations and many other qualities to
determine the student to be appointed. Of course, if there is a tie, the
Appointments Chair can break it."
The two final members of the
committee were chosen out of seven
total applicants yesterday. The student panel will have its first meeting tomorrow.

In addition to the Student
Financial Advisory Panel, the Ad
Hoc Financial Planning Group will
also meet with the Faculty Staff
Benefits Committee and host a student fireside chat in mid-November
to discuss the published draft with
all students. Students, faculty and
staff are also welcome to send the
group suggestions or comments
through the Financial Office's website.
The Phoenix reported on the college's endowment and budget in the
Sept. 3, 2008 issue.
Because Swarthmore derives
about 50 percent of its operating
income from its endowment, the
budget is very susceptible to influence by market fluctuations.
Previous projections gave about a
30 percent decrease in endowment.
Though Swarthmore had a lower
decrease than expected, the endowment is still down by 16.8 percent.
The college's endowment dropped
from SL4 billion to $ll billion in the
past year. As a result, the college
will have to compensate for the loss
by either cutting costs or increasing
revenue.
The Ad Hoc Financial Planning
Group plans to publish a preliminary draft of its proposal for the $8
million adjustment (down from the
originally projected $l5 million) in
November. After receiving feedback
from the Swarthmore community
and revising the proposal accordingly, the group will finalize its
plans and submit it to the Board of
Managers.

The group includes a list of sug-

gestions it has received for cutting
down costs and increasing revenue,
such as hosting more summer programs, reducing loan-free financial
packages, and encouraging doublesided printing and copying. The list
consists of only suggestions, and
has not been reviewed by the group.
The current Ad Hoc Financial
Planning
Group
consists
of
President Rebecca Chopp, Provost
Constance Hungerford, the vice
presidents, three deans, as well as
members of the Board of Managers
and a representation of Swarthmore
faculty and staff.

After allegedly having communication problems with the
Sustainability Committee, five
students decided to write a letter to President Rebecca Chopp
as a way to voice their concern.
"We do not feel wronged by

According to Socolar, the letter is meant to trigger a discus-

The problem with the definition of the committee's role surfaces whenever an important
decision needs to be made.
There is a disparity between
how the committee views its
role and what students believe
that role is.
Socolar said that there can
be problems when students who
want to undertake various initiatives are sent to get
approval.

"The committee is wrestling

Hansen-Lewis.
Ringle added, "If SusCom
wants to be only a recommendation body, it should be clear
about it."
Earthlust and Good Food are
concerned that the only way to
communicate with the committee for all types of issues is to
send its propositions through
Greenbox.
"There is a 'black box' aspect
of Greenbox," Socolar said.

Hansen-Lewis said that students feel like many proposals
are either not answered at all or
receive responses that "just
give a light reason why not to
consider something."
"Greenbox is sort of an illusion, to give [the committee] a
feeling that something is off
their backs," Hansen-Lewis
added.
Ringle said that there has
been a decrease in submissions
to the Greenbox.
She gave a few reasons to
explain why Greenbox has
failed to function as students
want it to.
For one, the propostions are
reviewed only on a bi-semestral
basis, and there is no designated person to do this. In addition, the propostions are not

discussed at the committee's

meetings.

The signatories feel that
their broad, comprehensive
suggestions,
such as the
Chickens Project, should not be
thrown in with some of
Greenbox's minor propositions,
such as not using paper towels
after hand-washing.
In the past, the small issues
are what the committee has
dealt with successfully, such as
setting all the campus computers on automatic shut down.
The signatories say that the
committee is very hesitant to
deal with larger issues.
"There is a general lack of
boldness from the committee,"
Socolar said.

Some of this "lack of boldness" may be the financial constraints that the school has been
facing. The expensive proposal
to increase wind power credits
to cover 100 percent of the energy used by the college was discussed before the economic crisis, however.
There has been confusion
concerning former president Al
Bloom's views on the subject.
According to Roswell, even

before the economic downturn,
the committee had a mandate
from President Bloom to be
dealing with issues involving
no or low cost ventures.
Socolar said that Bloom told

excited about the idea of
increasing windpower buying,

but he said he would want to
hear the committee's recommendation on the subject.
"He wanted to hear bold decisions," Socolar said.
The committee decided it did
not have the authority to make
any decisions concerning wind
power.
Similarly,

the

Chickens

Project was discussed for four
sessions, resulting at the time
in no conclusions. According to
Ringle and Roswell, there are
several reasons why meetings

are so ineffective.
They both emphasized that
there are no actual agendas for
the meetings and things are
often left undiscussed.
"We tend to talk in circles"
said Ringle. "There are opposing views on the committee.
The most radical people are also

the most vocal."
Roswell said that students
are not a strong voice on the
committee. He said that while
he was good at making himself
audible at the meetings, he
started to feel like a broken
record and decided to quit.
"I was more frustrated than
insightful," he said.
The signatories of the letter
would like the committee to be
active in both decision making
and communication with students.
"If they would have said 'no'
[to the wind power proposition],
we would have respected that,"
Socolar said.

outlet for individuals to quickly

short form of communication.
This allows rapid creation and
consumption of information in
our 'always too busy' society."
English Literature Professor
Peter Schmidt, who graded
Sagolla's culminating essay, was
surprised by the explosion of
the Web.
"At the time Dom was here in
the mid-90s, the Internet was
just expanding and it was just
becoming clear that webpages
with sound, text and graphics

Schmidt said in an e-mail. "But I
didn't realize just how fast the
Internet would grow and how
quickly commercial it would
get, though I'm sure Dom pretty
much did."
Schmidt is concerned about

the many negative results of the
huge push for short form online
and looks forward to hearing
what Sagolla has to say about
them, but he is pleased with
many good aspects services like
Twitter have brought out.
"140-word messages filled an
important niche in the Internet

ecosystems that lots of us didn't

predict, but we were just blind,"
Schmidt said. "Twitter postings
can have a profound effect on
networking, quick organizing,
escaping censorship (as with the
posting coming out of Iran during the elections there) and
keeping active sites where folks

can follow the adventures of
their friends or others who
interest them."
Sagolla continues to keep a
blog at Dom.net. He also founded the social iPhone app creator
DollarApp and helped create the
Obama 'OB app.

Chicken project receives
administrative approval

First National Day of Writing events

met.

BY AMELIA POSSANZA

"It's not just a matter of someone at Swarthmore approving it,"
Scheub said. "It's the whole committee. They're really scrutinizing
it-"
The cultural nature of the chicken project complicates approval.
While there are clear guidelines for
farming animals and research animals, it is unclear which category
these animals fall into since they
will be used to educate students
about farming and to produce a
small number of eggs. Currently,
the pair is working with the biology department to ensure that the
treatment of the chickens will meet
requirements for both scenarios.
"The lACUC is willing to work
with us," Scheub said. "[But] it's
really changed the timeline."
The chicks will arrive as early
as December or as late as January.
The initial proposed date was
November. This setback is in part
due to the time it will take to meet
lACUC guidelines, but is also a
consequence of the chickens that
the pair has chosen.
Scheub said that it's "important
to maintain heritage breeds,"
which means that the chickens
have not bred for favorable traits
but, rather, hatch only at certain
times of the year. Vogt and Scheub
hope to get some of the animals

The Swarthmore Chickens project proposal to bring 15 hens to
campus was approved by the
administration this Tuesday.
In late September, Nick Vogt 'l2

and Sarah Scheub 'l2 submitted a
final proposal to Jeff Jabco, Scott
Arboretum's Director of Grounds
and Coordinatorof Horticulture. It
was then passed along to Vice
President for Facilities and
Services Stu Haiti and the president's staff. The pair worked with
Hain over fall break to clarify some
final points before the project was
discussed again Tuesday.
"It lets us move forward," Vogt
said of the decision. "[But] there
are some other things we still need
to figure out before we actually see
chickens."
The project still needs to secure
funding, but the approval to move
forward will help them, as many of
the options the pair is looking into
require institutional approval.
The other obstacle they face is
securing
approval from the
Swarthmore Institutional Animal

faculty, staff and community members, oversees the care of any animals kept by the school and
ensures that USDA standards are

10,000 Villages provides gateway for world artisians

swarthmorephoenix.com

The

Phoenix's Amelia Possanza

recently sat down with Doug Dirks, a
public relations staffer at the non-profit
10,000 Villages. The company is one of
the largest fair trade organizations in

the world it sells work that represents
cultures from around the world. Dirks
spoke on campus Tuesday.
-

Amelia Possanza: What do you do
10,000 Villages as public relations?
Doug Dirks: Basically my job is,
well, two things. My main job is to go to
various functions like this one to promote fair trade and what we do. I talk
about how we work and spend a lot of
time basically telling the stories of artisans that we buy from, which is really,
from our point of view, what 10,000
Villages is all about. [lt's about] getting
to know people who otherwise don't
earn enough income and then we can
work together with them so that they
can begin to earn a regular income that
they consider to be fair so that they can
start making progress with their family
and their community. We find that if we
tell those people's stories, we can get
more people involved here on this side
of the ocean. A lot of people do really
care what's happening, and they like to
get involved, so we find the most effective way to promote what we do is to
tell stories about the artisans that we
buy from. Another part of my job is to
run what are called learning tours. We
take our staff and volunteers on trips to
visit artisans in various countries
where we work. And that's so that
someone like Lisa, for instance, who is
the manager at our Media store, would
go on a trip like that and then she
would have personal stories to tell
about artisans that she could use to tell
to her customers in her store. We do
some of that as well.
AP: How did you get involved with
this non-profit?
DD: I'm from Canada originally. I
was working with a big accounting firm
in Vancouver and was basically bored
with my work, and my wife and I volunteered to work with Mennonite
Central Committee, which is a relief
and development organization run by
Mennonite churches. And the work is
similar to Peace Corps. We ended up
getting sent to Bangladesh, and there
our job was to work in what's called job
creation. That was helping really poor
people to start small businesses so
eventually they could become business
owners and be self-employed. We found
out very quickly that in places like
Bangladesh there are no consumer markets so people Tiad to sell their products
to other countries, and one of them was
the United States. We came to believe
that helping especially women in
Bangladesh to make a product that they
could sell for export and they could
earn some money was a really good way
to help those people. The weakness in
that was selling the product, so we
decided that we needed to go home and
get some help marketing these prod-

for

ucts.

AP: Is fair trade feasible in this economic climate?
DD: Yeah. We think so.
AP: How does 10,000 Villages make it

feasible?

DD: Our business has definitely
slowed down due to the recession,
there's no doubt about that, just like
everybody else. But our sales are continuing and we really haven't laid any-

one off and we haven't closed any
stores. But from our point of view you
have to run fair trade like a real business. I cannot expect to ask you to pay
three times as much for your scarf. I
believe that you need to pay them fairly, but most people aren't willing to pay
very much more for a scarf in any other
store. We work at that in a couple of
ways. Number one we go in and if we're
buying that scarffrom somebody in...
AP: Ecuador.
DD: Ecuador. We would get to know
the people in Ecuador well enough so
that they would say to us, 'Yes you're
paying us fairly for this product.' That
means we're probably paying more
than somebody at say Banana Republic.
And so we have to figure out how to
make our business less expensive in the
middle part of what we do. What we try
to do is we try to eliminate as many
middlemen as possible and make the
relationship as direct as possible. In
our own organization we have deliberately...most of the people who work for
us have deliberately chosen to work for
less than they could work for elsewhere. Some people say to us that that's
not realistic, but we find lots of people
who want to. work for us. It's part of the
whole notion of fair trade.
AP: How does 10,000 Villages find all
these different artisan groups?
DD: It's mostly through these connections that we have. Our parent
organization is MCC and it has people
working in more that fifty countries. If
one of those people runs into someone
who makes a nice basket and they don't
make enough money to send their kids
to "school, then they might say to us,
'Hey we know these people who live in
this village who make really nice baskets. Do you think you could help them
have an income?' Other times the way
it starts is we're already buying products from a group let's say in India and
for instance recently we bought textiles
from a group in Calcutta and the
woman who heads up that group said to
us, T know another group of women in
a town just outside of Calcutta who do

really nice beadwork. Do you think you
could buy some jewelry from them?'
And so people in India are referring
other people in India to us. We're
always looking for a personal connection because we will not buy a product
until we know who the people are and
know that they are poor enough. We
will not buy products from people who
are already successful in business.
We're looking for people who otherwise
don't have enough work.
AP: Is there a relationship between
doing fair trade and doing stuff that's
sustainable and environmentally con-

scious?
DD: Not directly. Whenever we buy
anything, that's one of the issues that
we look at. For instance, when we buy a
good deal of wood products from
Northern India and so we're heavily
involved with a number of Indian agencies for reforestation. Close to forty percent of our product line is made from
recycled materials and almost all the
rest of it would probably be included in
a list of sustainable materials. We're
not cutting down the last tree in the forest. We're not polluting water. That's
not our primary focus. Initially we got
involved in this kind of thing not
because we were trying to be green but
because the people we were working
with were recyclers and green out of
necessity, not by choice. They were so
poor that they had to recycle and the
only stuff they had access to was stuff
that they could scrounge. This picture
frame is made out of used bicycle and
motorcycle chains. These frames are
made of bones and cattle that die anyway.

AP: Do you have a favorite artisan

story?

DD: The one story that is really
important to me is a woman that I know
in Bangladesh. Her name is Moriam,

Moriam* makes this book for
instance. She does the marbalizing on
the cover. I first met her when she was
a beggar on the street when I lived in
Bangladesh in 1984. A guy that I was
working with his name is Abdur Rub
and

October 22, 2009

chose Moriam as one of six women to
teach how to make handmade paper.
The first time I met her Abdur Rub
said, 'We have to decide whether she's
poor enough to work with. We've got to
go visit her at her house.' We went with
her to her house and we went to her
neighborhood and I though, ahh this
neighborhood's not too bad. And we
went to this nice house with a fence
around it and a garden, but she went
around behind this house and there
was a lean-to made out of bamboo and
grass, and there was a cow inside the
lean-to. And she said, 'That's my
house.' She and her two daughters lived
in this little lean-to cowshed with three
cows. In exchange for looking after the
cows, the man who owned the house let
her and her three daughters live there.
She thought I looked surprised so she
explained, "In the winter time it gets
cold so my daughters and I we can sleep
with the cows.' As Abdu Rub and I were
leaving the guy who owned the house
was coming in through the front gate
and he hollered at us, 'What are you
doing here' because he thought we were
trespassing. We explained well we were
visiting Moriam. 'Why would you to do
that? My cows are worth more than
her.'
The last time I was in Bangladesh
was a year and a half ago with my wife
and kids. We went to Moriam's house.
She owns her own house now with-two
of her cows and some chickens. She is
the chairperson of the paper company.
She has run for local political office.
And her oldest daughter went to college
and is now a doctor. To see thatkind of
a thing happen to Moriam and her
daughters, sort of going from begging
on the street, literally being on the edge
of starvation, not being worth as much
as a cow to today where in essence she's
the CEO of her business that employs
300 people. That's what fair trade is all
about. It's about giving opportunities to
people like Moriam so they can earn an
income so they can begin to educate
their families so they can have some
hope for the future.

The sophomore said, "I'm waiting to hear back

around $BOO, but the students would not have to do the
community service hours, and the evidence would be
expunged.
No students have said they are definitely pleading
guilty, but a couple are thinking of it, weighing the
options against doing the diversion program or fighting the case.
Pleading guilty means only having to pay about
$4OO in fines, with no community service hours and
much lesser legal fees. The citation stays on the
record, but it can be expunged at the age of 2L
Until then, students might have trouble finding a
job, though Dick Wynn, Vice President for Finance,

said the citations would not have an effect on on-cam-

An anonymous freshman who is still not sure what

she is doing said, "As far as pleading guilty, it's a lesser fine. Obviously it's on your record until you're 21,
but after you're 21, it can be expunged."
Durbin said that getting the citation expunged at 21
involves sending out letters "to various people who
have recorded" the citation. She did not know how
much it would cost, but said "it would be cheaper in
terms of time," because there would be no community
service hours.
District Justice Lisa LaCianca will preside over
court for the cited students. The students will all go in
together, and anyone who wants a task force will be
assigned one that day. Anyone who wants a trial cotild
have it that day, or could schedule it for a different

New magazine creates fashion outlet Haverford fall
BY PRARTHANA JAYARAM
BICONEWS.COM, OCT. 6, 2009
To many, the notion of "style" in
the bi-college community is embodied by sweatpants, t-shirts, and
sneakers. To a group offive motivated students, however, clothes and
fashion are a mode of artistic expression, and should not be restricted by
any social standards. These are the
five editors of Feathers and Fur, the
fashion and style magazine that
made its campus debut this spring.
Pooling resources and inspirations from Bryn Mawr and
Haverford, Darren White 'll, Rachel
Oliner 'll, Simran Singh 'lO,
Elizabeth Svokos 'll, and Juliana
Reyes 'll came together last semester to create the magazine. White

brought everyone together to work
on the project, based on their similar

interests.
"We all wanted to have some kind
of outlet for fashion and style on
campus," he said.
The group initially met in Lunt
Basement early last spring to discuss
the project and their ideas. The publication took shape over the course
of the next few weeks.
"We wanted to stay away from
Cosmo-type magazines," said Oliner.
"We wanted [our magazine] to be a
little more serious." The editors'
inspiration came from their everyday lives, from magazines, from runway shows. "We really want to create
a mood [with our shoots], and get at
the styles that we see emerging," she
explained.

The group applied for and
received the Student Arts Grant

THE PHOENIX

from the Hurford Humanities
Center, a one-time grant which
kicked the publication into gear.
Originally, the editors had considered something much smaller, such
as a newsletter. After they had
received the funding from the
Humanities Center, however, their
aspirations became more serious.
They began putting together ideas on
a much larger scale, arranging photo
shoots and interviews, planning articles and layout designs.
The maiden issue of Feathers and
Fur turned out to be 56 pages; the
group printed one thousand copies
and posted a PDF version of the publication online. Most of the work and
production was done solely by the
five founding editors. The team discovered early on that they had taken
on a much larger-scale project than
anticipated.

"We were in way over our heads,
but it worked out," explained White.

With only the five editors on board
to write, photograph, and design the
layout, the project quickly became
overwhelming.
Though pleased with the first

issue, the editors have since learned
that the magazine is a job for a larger team. This semester, they put
together a staffof about twenty other
students to help with all aspects of
production. The magazine aims to
bring in the work of real students.
One of the primary goals is to "showcase photographers and student
designers," said Oliner.
Both Oliner and Singh mentioned
that the magazine's next issue will
focus on more diverse, "unconventional". models. Indeed, challenging

people's assumptions about fashion
seems to be a primary goal of the
Editorial Board. Personally, White
explained his desire to "take the
intellectual community at Haverford
and apply that to fashion." Rather
than just being seen as a superficial
or frivolous thing, White wants the
college community to see fashion as
more substantial, something that
can be framed in an intelligent and
artistically meaningful way.
"We [the editors] are all into aca-

demics as well, but we love fashion,"
elaborated Reyes. "I do feel like we
are trying to inspire people—maybe
to dress up, but not necessarily by
wearing heels to class, but just by
putting effort into what they wear
and looking nice."
Svokos echoed her sentiments.
"People wear sweatpants to class all
the time, but I know there are a lot of
creative, exciting, eccentric people
on this campus." She strives to
inspire people to let their personalities shine through in what they
wear. "I think [the magazine] shows
people that style is everywhere and
there are lots of ways to get in touch
with the world of fashion," she
explained.

Feathers and Fur thus seeks to
introduce students to ideas they may
not have considered before. "We are
incredibly different from any other
publication on campus," said Reyes.
White agreed, adding that he strives
to call it a "style and culture magazine" rather than just a fashion magazine. "It is less about what designers people are wearing and more
about their creativity with what they
wear."

plenary review

BY HANNAH JAENICKE
BICONEWS.COM, OCT. 15, 2009
Four and half hours of Plenary resulted in
the passing of six of the nine proposed resolutions.
The passed resolutions approved creating a
cafe in the Haverford College Apartments,
reducing students' workload over religious holidays, expanding the Council of Twelve's mandate to include positions on the Appointments
Committee, making Haverford College a
polling site for elections, and clarifying the
alcohol policy and the constitution.
The most contentious debate occurred during the religious holidays resolution. Many students felt that Haverford did not sufficiently
accommodate students' religious observances,
while others felt that there did not need to be a
codified policy.
Will Harrison's resolution to approve the
creation of a cafe in HCA was passed, although
students were split over whether or not it
would further isolate students living in the
apartments, and whether Lunt Cafe and the
Coop would be adversely affected by a third
cafe.
The expansion of Council of Twelve's mandate to add four council members to the
Appointments Committee was contested by
many students, but was eventually passed by a
visual ballot.
Students overwhelmingly passed a resolution that stated that Haverford College should
be a polling site. However, the Election Board
has previously rejected such calls.
Revisions to the alcohol policy and the constitution clarified inconsistencies and removed
grammatical errors. There was little debate on
these resolutions, and students were overwhelmingly in favor.

Name: Rebecea Contreras
Class Year: 2013
From: Los Angeles
Current Residence: Mertz
What she's wearing:
"A Steven Alan shirt, a Converse skirt and flea market boots," Contreras described her winter-ready outfit.
Though she is sticking to mostly neutrals, like many do
in the colder weather, the jewel tone satin top is especially striking. While the runways and streets are fiUed

with dark jackets, camel coats and black or brown boots,
it's the addition of warm, bright colors that reappear
each fall season. The contrast between the dark grays or
black with rich purple or fuchsia, or even the jewel tone
clothing alone, brightens up an otherwise monochromatic outfit. Contreras' green blouse is a standout piece
that livens up the black skirt, boot and tights.

Her fashion influences and inspirations:
Contreras cited "people watching" as one of her influences. "I'm always inspired by people I see in Los
Angeles. I love seeing the young, slightly grungy look at
music shows, the put-together women of Beverly Hills,
the freedom of Venice Beach and the fresh style of Los
Feliz and Silver Lake," Contreras said. She also reveres
Audrey Hepburn and gypsies. "What inspires me are the
people who break from the mold a bit, highlighting
something unexpected in a look," she said.

Her most-loved designers:
"Chloe, Anna Sui or Marc Jacobs," Contreras said are
some of her favorite designers. "The Chloe aesthetic is
beautifully soft and feminine, Anna Sui is fun and whimsical without being over-the-top, and Marc Jacobs' clothes
are quirky, comfortable and adorable." Her designer
choices reflect her self-described "sassy and classy" style.
Anna Sui and Marc Jacobs both mix high fashion with a
quirky sense of humor in many of their clothes. This
fusion can be seen in many of Contreras' everyday outfits.

Favorite item in her closet:
"Probably my Frye boots or a 50s

Contreras said. Frye boots are the quintessential vintage-inspired boot that fashionistas, bloggers and magazines rave about.
Contreras also mentioned that she loves "to
play with make-up." While many tend to
think fashion is just about the clothes, makeup adds character to any outfit. The kaleidoscope of eye shadow colors on the runways
and the jewel-encrustedeyelashes on Chanel's
Fall 2009 collection show how much make-up
is an essential part of the fashion world. "It's
such an easy way to change your look,"

Coming Out Week fosters annual campus dialogue

swarthmorephoenix.com

BY MIRIAM HAUSER
mhauserl@swarthmore.edu

With the end of fall break on Sunday
came the beginning of the annual Coming
Out Week, a Swarthmore tradition that
encourages awareness of queer issues.
Over the course of the week, the queer
community and the student body as a
whole have had the opportunity to attend
various events addressing these issues.
"I hope that people are able to take a
break from their post-break midterms
and projects long enough to really take
advantage of the lectures and amazing
performances that are being put on,"
Lang Haynes 'l2, a member of the planning committee for Coming Out Week,
said.
Coming Out Week is linked to National
Coming Out Day, which encourages people to disclose their sexual orientation or
gender identity. Coming Out Week at
Swarthmore operates separately from
National Coming Out Day, but aims
toward a similar purpose.
The week opened with AIDS Walk
Philly, the Delaware Valley's "largest
annual HTV/AIDS public awareness and
fundraising event," according to the
event's website. The walk, which began
in 1987, is 12 kilometers long (5.4 miles)
through downtown Philadelphia and
aims to raise money to support HIV/AIDS
education, prevention and services.

Other events, open and closed, have alternative queer-themed dry parlor

Week, but continued to be met with both
negative and positive responses. In some
cases, the chalkings have even been
washed out by students.
The chalkings appeared on campus
walks this Monday morning, with messages such as "Being called a faggot is not
fabulous" or "Vaginas are gross" signed

"a gay man."
Other messages included listings of
well-known members of the LGBT community and messages of advocacy and
support for the LGBT community.
As in past years, the response to this
year's chalkings has been mixed, even by
people in support of their messages.
First-year Mariah Parker, for instance,
admired the chalkings' messages, but was
worried about their effectiveness and
purpose.

"It seems to me that they should do
more for outreach, as opposed to the
chalkings," Parker said. "It seems more
good could be done in the community."
But for many, the chalkings, and
Coming Out Week as a whole, are simply
a reminder of the support that can be
found in the Swarthmore community for
all, regardless of sexual orientation or
gender identity.

The week can offer those dealing with
issues of sexual orientation or gender
identity a message of acceptance and
encouragement and facilitate campus
wide discussion about queer issues.

Swarthmore senior uses film to enact wider change

from Chester that taught them
the basics of filmmaking and
then "emphasized that the project was theirs" as the youths collaborated to produce a 45 minute
film. The film addressed important issues affecting teenagers
such as single-parent homes,
peer pressure, drugs, sex and
relationships, allowing the participants to explore some of the
prevalent issues that they or
their friends were facing or that
they saw at school. While Young
is careful not to overstress the
therapeutic value of the exercise, she sees it as a constructive
way for teenagers to engage in a

Swarthmore students are
often amazed by the unique stories of their peers and their passion and drive to make a difference. One Swattie who evokes
such amazement is Joslyn
Young 'lO.
Young is an educational studies and anthropology/sociology

one thing remained constant:
her desire to be a teacher. Young

building since I spend so much
time there," Young said about
the partnership.
Molly Weston, Young's friend
and a fellow Lang Scholar and
Writing Associate, has seen how
much Young dedicates herself to
her projects. "She put in a
tremendous amount of time and
energy into making something
unique and really amazing for
her students [at Chester Voices
for Change], all on top of playing
a varsity sport, being a WA,
working with Learning for Life
and being a Swarthmore stu-

"I wanted to give these kids
an opportunity to voice their stories, but also to think in terms of
consequences and solutions. It's
not meant to be a how-to film. It
just shows what is happening
out there and that there are
ways we can come together and
stay positive," Young said.
Like most Swatties, Young
stays well occupied. In addition
to running Chester Voices for
Change, she also plays field
hockey for Swarthmore and is a
Writing Associate. Moreover,
she has been involved with
Learning for Life, a group which
pairs Swarthmore students with
Swarthmore staff members to
engage in common activities.
Since her first year, Young and
her Learning for Life partner, an
EVS technician, have been
going to the gym, cooking and

dent," Weston said.
Still, Young's Lang Project
remains a central part of her
life. It is the culmination of her
academic and personal endeavors and will serve as the
research portion of her thesis in
anthropology and education.
According to Young, the thesis
will focus on "how the Chester
Voices for Change program
affected its participants and how
they see their identity in relationship to the wider community." Above all, Young's Lang
Project represents her faith in
media as an instrument of social
change and empowerment.
"For youth today, with new
technology and media, film is a
way to tell stories. One of my
main goals and passions in life
is to give people the tools to
share their stories with a broad-

er audience," Young said.
Young is currently getting
certified to teach middle and
high school social sciences.
However, she is also seeking
opportunities to further her
work with students outside academics.
"My

experiences

at

Swarthmore and with my Lang
project have made me interested
in teaching outside the classroom," she said.
Young stands out as an
inspiring example of how individual students at Swarthmore
take their passion beyond academics to effect change in the
greater community. As Young
says, "The best thing about
Swarthmore is being part of a
community where students, professors and deans alike are
interested in how different
realms of life come together;
where it is strongly encouraged
to connect academics with practice, community and passion."
Daniel Symond 'IL who previously worked with Young on
her Lang Project, emphasized
how Young's strong commitment has made for a legitimate,
undoubtedly long-lasting organization.
Symond said, "It is easy for

well-meaning student initiatives
to start and stumble because of

the infinite difficulties ofbalancing the needs of many, all while
trying to keep up with the pace
of individual academic work."

According to Young, the film
produced by Chester Voices for
Change will be shown at

Swarthmore soon.

that I hold
so dear. Alright, so yes, this is my senior
year. Maybe I have an itch. Maybe I feel
ready. Maybe looking forward (and backward) I know it's time to break routine.
But why should I wait to shake things
up when I can do so now? Why should
you? There are an unlimited number of
ways you can placate your boredom without resorting to an early exit or writing
smutty literature for the college paper.
You can spice up theroutine in your daily
life. We all have routines that could use a
little variety. But if switching from Axe to
Old Spice is not the kind of spice that
you're looking for, maybe it's time you
add some adventure to a different routine. Your sexual routine, per se. No matter your experience level or relationship
status, a twist in the sexual schedule will
make everything better.
The first one goes for everyone. You
may think this is trivial advice, but
according to the National Health and
Social Life survey, over half of women (58
■■«■■■■■■■

percent) don't do it. Ladies and gentlemen
(but ladies especially) masturbate, please!

Masturbate with porn, masturbate with
your imagination, masturbate with your
partner, masturbate with friends
just
DO IT! Masturbation is fun, it's healthy
and it's a great stress-reliever. Taking
time out of your day to take care of your-

self is essential for happy living. After
class, practice or whenever, block out a
half-hour, light a candle, spray some lilac
on your pillow, do what you have to do in
order to get in the mood and release. This
is therapy. This is your time. Making it
special by taking small steps (like a masturbation playlist or giving yourself a big
chunk of the afternoon to indulge) will
bring peace to your body and mind.
Of the women masturbators in the
U.S., about half of them (47 percent)
report feeling guilty for the act. But if
there's any way I can encourage more
women to masturbate, it would be to
point out that masturbation is natural.
It's so natural, in fact, that I can remember engaging in some form of self-pleasure before I even knew what masturbation was! This memory is vivid, and I
think it's a great testament to the virtue
of human instinct.
At about nine years old, I had my
friend Molly over for a play date. Up in
my room, we were amusing ourselves
with stuffed animals. "Look!" I said to her
as I picked up my stuffed leprechaun.
"This feels really good." While I'm aware
that this story sounds more like sexual
harassment than a defense of the virtue of
masturbation, my point is this: My body
was programmed to masturbate. Most
people's are.
Humans are sexual creatures: If we
weren't, our race would have died off a
long time ago. And while I'm certain I
stumbled across masturbation by accident, I know that it was a fortuitous accident, an accident waiting to happen.
Now that I've bored you with my masturbation spiel, I'd like to turn my atten-

tion to the seasoned veterans. The following activities will give your sex life the
variety it craves
and this type of variety, unlike habitual partner variety, will
not leave you with genital discomfort and
a grudge the week after.
L Bring some food into the bedroom.

Sounds like a movie, or maybe an episode
of Seinfeld, right? Well if warm deli meats
don't get you as hot as George Costanza,
try some whipped cream and a thong.
Nothing will titillate your partner more
than the sight of you nearly naked with
only strawberries and cream covering
your nipples. To make the scene more
exciting, turn off the lights and light a
candle or two. Arrange yourself how you
like and then give your partner a text and
s/he will receive the surprise of his/her
life.

2. Switch up the positions. Classic missionary and woman-on-top are great
pinch hitters. They're intimate and safe.
But hundreds of sex positions are out
there just waiting to be explored (Check
www.sexinfolOLcom/sexualposiout
tions.shtml).

Go online with your partner and check
some of them out. Reading how-tos and
browsing sexy pictures together can be a
huge turn-on, the perfect foreplay for
great and adventurous sex. Of the more
known positions, don't shy away from
doggy style and don't let the name deter
you. This position allows for deep penetration, and for some Women, provides
the only angle by which a G-spot orgasm
can be attained. Reaching down to give
her most sensitive spot a little exterior
love, doggy-style will have you both howling.
For opposite-sex couples, women can
greatly increase the pleasure of the missionary position by lifting their legs up.
The farther they lift up, the deeper the
penetration. What's more, having your
legs up allows for direct stimulation of
the clitoris. Without giving an anatomy
tutorial, suffice it to say that making the
clitoris happy is the holy grail of heterosexual (or female) hide-and-go-seek.
3. Utilize your mirror. Most dorm
rooms come equipped with full-length
mirrors on the closet doors. Positioning
yourselves in a spot where you can watch

Michael Ahn Phoenix Staff

will add an entirely new element to sex.
Whereas before you were living and seeing the action as a participant, now you
can participate and be a spectator simultaneously. Adding the mirror is like creating a
third-party perspective where one can see
the action from the outside while partaking at the same time
like voyeurism,

minus the creepy guy at the window.
What's more, watching you and your
partner during sex gives you instant (but
secret) celebrity status. Without having a
Kim Kardashian or Paris Hilton moment
befall you, you can star in your very own
porno.

In actuality, the options available to
someone looking to alleviate sexual boredom are boundless. The extra effort it
takes (which is really not much effort at
all) is well worth the reward. With a few
extra minutes and a bit of ingenuity, your
body, your mind and your partner will
thank you.

This morning, I was standing
on my balcony drinking a cup of
coffee and marveling at the
serenity of Oxford at 8 a.m. when
the fire alarm went off, causing
me to drop my mug onto the
grass twenty feet below and
scramble to figure out what
could possibly be going on that
could make such an ungodly
noise so early in the morning.
And that's a lot like how the
last three weeks have been
moments when everything
seems to be working out just fine,
followed by bursts of cataclysmic, earth-shattering realization that nothing is as it seems.
Looking back on my last column
where I was scared that I wouldn't have anything to talk about
with British university students,
I'm now left wondering, what the
hell was I thinking? I haven't had
a spare minute to find a British
university student to strike up a
conversation with, because
every single moment of my day

is spent struggling to keep my
head above the rising tide of
British-ness that threatens my
very existence.
But when I actually sit down
and think about it, the experience of being totally disoriented
doesn't make much sense,
because, superficially, nothing is
all that different. Sure, British
electrical plugs are the size of a
fist and look like medieval torture devices, and sure, transacting in cash in the UK necessitates the use of an array of coins
that appear to have no rhyme or
reason guiding their diameter,
color, shape or thickness and
that range in value from 1 pence
to 2 pounds
but really, those
are all small details in the grand
scheme of things.
(To go back to the coin issue
for a second, when you think
about it, a £2 coin is worth close
to $4. Once I got over the shock of
coins being useful for more than
laundry, that realization left me
wondering what kind of podunk
economy actually uses a coin
worth $4? The Sacagawea dollar,
the laughingstock of American
currency, was bad enough. And
now I can buy a drink from
Starbucks with a single coin
that, conveniently, is about the
size of a dinner plate. Have you

movements and appearance,
they become correspondingly
familiar to the people watching
them to a point.
There's a level of similarity
just shy of verisimilitude where
things that are really, really
close to human become incredibly creepy. For example, "The
Polar Express" is widely regarded as a disturbing movie, not
because Christmas is inherently
that frightening, but because the
computer-generated people fall
into the uncanny valley and look
"off." There's nothing technically
wrong with them

and in fact,
the CGI work in the film is, by
the books, fantastic
but some
viewers invariably hate watching the movie. By contrast, a
much more stylized animated
film like "The Incredibles" is
fine, because it's far enough
away from the valley that we
don't find Mr. Incredible threatening to our humanity.
And I think that international
travel works basically the same
way I came to the U.K. expecting
to find superficial cultural differences, but a society that, logistically speaking, functioned mostly in the same way as the United
States. I wasn't prepared for an
adjustment on the order of
spending a semester in Nepal,
because, logically, it shouldn'tbe
as challenging to become acclimated to the fairly posh, suburban and tame Oxford as it would
be to find my way in Kathmandu.
But as these first few weeks have
shown, it's my assumptions
about the similarities between
England and the States that
makes living here so disconcerting. Things just don't work as
expected.
For instance, while my patch

Why Obama deserves the Nobel Defending 350.org
StaffEditorial

Presented with the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize on
October 9, President Barack Obama seemed
almost embarrassed as he addressed the honor
with the requisite modesty and resolve to be
resilient in the face of arduousness. And with
good reason, cry many political commentators

and ordinary citizens across the globe. Here we
have the five-member Norwegian Nobel committee selecting a world leader who is not even
a year into his first term
who was nominated
not even two weeks into his first term, in fact
and has, by all appearances, achieved very little
in the way of concrete peace.
There is no denying that Obama's peace
efforts are still very much a work in progress. In
fact, the president currently finds his country
embroiled in two violent wars in the Middle
East. Action, not words, the prevailing advice
given to young upstarts goes; Obama has seemingly offered nothing but words. He has given
numerous speeches regarding the conflicts
related to Afghanistan, Iraq, Armenia and
Turkey, Palestine and Israel, Iran... and yet
nothing has been done beyond mere posturing,
the critics say. Still two senseless wars rage on,
inheritances of the Bush administration (perhaps it would be helpful for Obama to solve
those first before the committee in Norway
starts handing out peace prizes!). Iran still may
or may not have deadly nuclear weapons.
But to ignore what Obama actually has
accomplished would be to ignore the magnitude
of the transformation in the international community that his presidency has wrought, barely
nine months past Inauguration Day. Forget for a
moment the success of the Armenian-Turkish
pact to normalize relations, fittingly sealed the
day after Obama received the Peace Prize honor,
or even the success of bringing in Russia's
strong, oil-fueled hand against Iran in the
nuclear proliferation debate. Forget for a
moment the precedence established by the
Norwegian Nobel committee in honoring other
noble works in progress, like the struggle of
Archbishop Desmond Tutu against Apartheid,
an endeavor still unfulfilled when Tutu received
the Nobel in 1984.
Simply focus on the return of a previously
belligerent and arrogant United States of
America to harmonious and collaborative lines
of international communication.
That is the America
and the world
that
Obama has been striving for even before he
became president. Detractors mock the Nobel
committee for being seduced by Obama's rockstar status overseas, and in doing so they fail to
understand how powerful the motivations for
our president's rock-star treatment are. How
many other world leaders can draw out hundreds of thousands of raucous supporters in a
foreign country? How many can do it while representing a country still governed by a xenophobic and pathologically hawkish administration?

And yet that was what greeted Obama as he
stood before Berlin in July 2008, with nothing
else to offer but, of course, words.

op-art

by

carey

At that time, in the city which once hosted

the second-most famous wall of all time, he

spoke of tearing down the walls dividing the
international community. Then, as now, he
spoke of refusing to let America turn inwards.
"Now is the time to join together, through constant cooperation, strong institutions, shared
sacrifice, and a global commitment to progress,
to meet the challenges of the 21st century,"
Obama said, still merely the Democratic candidate for the presidency.
That is the goal Obama continues to strive for
today. The consistency ofhis message, even as it
is tempered by practical realities, and the promise that his approach holds for the world are
why he is a deserving selection for the Nobel

Peace Prize.
There may have been other candidates who

more concretely achieved peace
but what is
concrete peace? Ours is a world that often looks
like it is falling apart at the seams; it is one that

renders even one of the greatest peace advocates
of all, Aung San Suu Kyi, a symbolic and emotional power against the maneuvering of
Myanmar's military junta. Similarly, Obama's
determined aim to bring America back into
channels of international cooperation is a testament to the fact that yes, sometimes there really
is change and hope that we can believe in.
Perhaps, then, it is helpful to consider
Obama's Nobel triumph a symbolic one
and
also helpful to recognize this that need not
necessitate negative connotations. Nobel prizes,
after all, are essentially symbolic gestures.
Would Einstein be less of a scientist sans his
Nobel Prize in Physics?
More importantly, have Obama's deeds been
enhanced by his Nobel Peace Prize? Probably
not. But the prize is an affirmation of his message, a vote ofconfidence that indeed, his insistence on marching on the path toward peace is
praiseworthy even if reality forces him to
engage in conflict along the way. As intangible
or naively lofty the notion of global optimism
may be, the truth is that the rapidity with which
America has recaptured good-guy status and its
positive ripple effects are nothing short of
shocking. His Nobel Prize, then, might just be a
symbol of a symbol of peace
but considerable
is the optimism it symbolizes.
It may be erroneous to award a man based on
his promise. Most Valuable Player awards in
sports, after all, are not handed out to the individuals who had the most talent, but to those
who apply their talent most successfully. But to
cite this against Obama's triumph is to once
again deny the scale of his accomplishments.
Another Nobel Peace Prize laureate, Elie Wiesel,
once said, "Words can sometimes, in moments
of grace, attain the quality of deeds." America's
re-entry into the international conversation,
pride intact but ego in check, surely qualifies as
a moment of grace. And when our president's
words do not happen to lead directly to peace
treaties, they certainly promote, on the biggest
stage possible, the cause of peace.
Is there much else that a Nobel Peace Prize
demands of its

pietsch

So
when

his

should display
no trace of

BY ZEIN NAKHODA AND HANNAH JONES
wnakhodl@swarthmore.edu and hjones4@swarthmore.edu

As Earthlust organizers and proponents of the 350 Campaign, we
wish to add our perspective on the current climate dialogue and the
efficacy of 350 in response to Soren Larson's column,
"How to fix the planet
with economics in mind."
We recommend reading the latest Synthesis Report
from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change, or IPCC, for those interested in the true depth and gravity
of the climate debate.
First, let's not underestimate (or talk around) the true consequences of global warming. Admittedly, it's extremely difficult to
quantify the social cost ofcarbon (SCC) for cost-benefit analysis. But
even when we try, the IPCC has determined that aggregated figures
ofSCC are very likely underestimated. What we do know is that the
negative effects of climate change are occurring more rapidly than
our models predicted. Adaptation alone is not expected to cope with
the effects of climate change, and it's widely understood that any
benefits will certainly be outweighed by negative effects. Also, the
idea that our concern for climate change is only to "help poor people" is grossly misguided and rife with the hubris of environmental
privilege. We need only look to recent deadly heat waves in Europe
and the tragedy of Hurricane Katrina to realize that even the most
developed nations are not immune to the costs of global warming.
Our greatest threat, however, is a runaway climate where positive feedback systems push the climate into such disequilibrium
that extreme changes become unpredictable and uncontrollable.
James Hansen, with a team of NASA climate scientists, has determined 350 parts per million, or ppm, of CO2 as the global tipping
point, using the latest paleoclimate models. A reduction to 350 ppm
is necessary to balance Earth's energy flux, representing the goal of
preventing runaway climate change. This is the goal the Earth has
set for us, and no "revision ofambitions" will change that. The question is not if we should strive for 350, but how to achieve our goal.
The take-home message from Larson's article was that the U.S.
shouldrefrain from signing a climate treaty because a Pigouvian tax
on carbon would impart net social cost to developing nations by halting economic growth. However, the IPCC offers a wide variety of policy instruments available to create incentives for mitigation action,
a carbon tax being only one of them. There are increasing possibilities for synergy related to strategic implementation of energy efficiency and renewable energy, which can be extended beyond traditional macroeconomic climate policy to include agricultural policy,
forest conservation and insurance practices.
Of course, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change already explicitly provides full consideration to the special
circumstances of developing nations. The Framework also supports
the idea that developed nations should be willing to take the lead in
combating climate change, which we should, given our disproportionate contribution to the problem. In fact, it's imperative for the
U.S. to engage in climate negotiations because of our unique position to lead the creation of an effective treaty, the success of which
is in the interest of every nation.
At this point, we would like to introduce the 350.0rg campaign as
a social movement. After all, the role of climate policy in
Copenhagen makes up only one piece in a large puzzle that is a complete solution to our climate predicament. Governments will not
institute strong legislation without public pressure. Corporations do
not alter production and shipping practices without consumer pressure. Furthermore, behavior and lifestyle changes can contribute to
mitigation across all sectors. Such puzzle pieces have an important
characteristic: they depend on the participation of all of us! The
350.0rg campaign is an international effort to build a social movement around the solutions to the climate crisis and the goal of 350
ppm. As a tool for education and organizing, it's succeeding in building a sense of urgency and inspiring hew possibilities for our planet, with over 3,500 registered grassroots actions in more than 160
countries so far. Apart from providing political pressure to leaders
who will meet in Copenhagen, the campaign joins a myriad ofother
global grassroots campaign that charge each global citizen to do
their part in the struggle against climate change.
Larson claims 350's solution is simple and wrong.
The science of 350 is not a solution, nor is it simple. It's our latest
scientific estimate for the safe upper limit of CO2 in the atmosphere.
The social movement centered on 350 can't be wrong or right, but its
success depends on our ability to welcome change and actively
engage in the dialogue of real solutions.
Enter 350 Week. Our understanding of the climate crisis and
social change informs us that our solutions are not only in the hands
of economists and scientists. Innovations in engineering, design,
architecture, lifestyle and how we fundamentally relate to our environment all play a part in the grand solution, even if they're difficult
to quantify. The grand solution is something we can build community around, and is why we will succeed in reaching 350 ppm: our
potential for change is only limited by our creativity and will and
our ability to come together.

The videos released by the duo fueled
the long-brewing anti-ACORN sentiment on Capitol Hill and led to a vote of
345-75 to prohibit federal money from
going to ACORN.
The Census Bureau also cut ties with
ACORN, which was originally to assist

It's safe to say that ACORN is thoroughly vilified.
Is all of this really over the organization's apparent support of prostitution?
Take a guess. The videos were just the
tip of the iceberg on a barrage of complaints that have accumulated since the
first Bush term against the nation's
largest anti-poverty advocacy organization. The central question here is not
why ACORN's low-level employees
advised a pimp on how to start a brothel, but why conservatives have made it

Rather than indicating government
fiscal carelessness, as the Examiner
seeks to imply, this should indicate that
ACORN was deemed legitimate
and
at times the expert
in its activities to
promote fair housing development by
the government agencies that awarded
them the money.
The real reason that Republicans
have been on a (now successful) crusade to defame ACORN is that ACORN
engages in activities that undermine,
even if on an indirect micro-scale, the
power-bases of the Republican party
and the corporate interests behind it.
Its voter registration efforts in lowincome communities result in increases in Democrat voters, so Republicans
made loud accusations of voter fraud.
ACORN's opposition to predatory bank
practices threaten the interests of the
financial sector, so Republicans turned
ACORN into the bad guy by stating, as
the McCain-Palin campaign did in a
web ad, that ACORN bullies community
banks and caused the financial crisis.

tration falsely filled out forms in order
to get paid for work they did not do.
ACORN reported these false voter registration forms to the authorities, as they
were required to do by law, and one
would expect that this action absolved
the organization of any responsibility
for the crime of voter registration
fraud.
These incidents however, provided
conservatives with ammunition against
their entire voter registration initiative. During the Bush administration,
Karl Rove was on a campaign to bring
charges against ACORN for voter fraud.
The U.S. Attorney of New Mexico,
David Iglesias, was fired in 2007 for failing to come up with charges against
ACORN; notably, the reason he did not
charge voter fraud was because there
was no voter fraud to begin with anyway.

As Iglesias points out in an interview on PBS's NOW, even one lawsuit
against voter fraud can effectively
scare other members of the community
from voting; political encouragement of
such lawsuits is simply a new type of

minority and low-income voter suppression.
The extreme right-wing spokesmen
have been ranting about ACORN for
years, but it was propelled into the
mainstream only during the 2008 election cycle. Even the "liberal" media
was guilty of fear-mongering: an independent study titled "Manipulating the
Public Agenda: Why ACORN was in the
News, and What the News Got.Wrong"
examined 647 news stories regarding

ACORN in mainstream national news
outlets, including The New York Times
and The Washington Post, and found
that they were overwhelmingly negative and failed to verify the false accusations being made by conservatives
about ACORN's alleged voter fraud.
McCain came out with the mother of
all allegations at the Oct. 15, 2008, presidential debate. Apart from a cheap
attempt to link Obama with the implicitly criminal ACORN in the minds of
viewers, McCain asserted that the
activities of this grassroots community
organizing movement were "destroying
the very fabric of our democracy."
What does it mean if grassroots community organizing can be linked to the
idea of a destruction of democracy in
front of a mainstream audience by a
serious candidate for presidency? What
could be more democratic than individual citizens gathering to confront the
government about its failure to meet
their needs?
Granted, McCain along with the conservative media pundits are most likely
referring to bureaucratic mismanagement and not grassroots organizing
when they refer to a destruction of
democracy, but I'm fairly certain that
bureaucratic mismanagement is no
stranger to democratic governments.
Vilifying community organizing, something we also saw in criticisms of
Obama's resume, is essentially arguing
that the people in our society who have
the least should stay that way and stay
quiet. In an impressive turning of the
table, this argument turns marginalized communities into the big bad bully
while painting the privileged and powerful as innocent victims.
The scary thing is that as ridiculous
as this argument seems on paper, it has
succeeded.
I do not seek to imply that ACORN
should be absolved of its duty to responsibly carry out the functions it was created to do. Its management and leaders
should be held to the same standards
we hold for leaders of government and
corporations. However, the disproportionate ruckus that has been raised
about problems within the organization
has more to do with the dominant structural forces of the U.S. suppressing the
voices of the people it marginalizes
than it does with actual outrage-worthy
scandals.
The success that the anti-ACORN
movement has seen in shutting the
largest American grassroots community organization out of mainstream
power structures just means that not
only are we as a society permitting people to be marginalized, we are now preventing them from participating in one
of the only avenues for resistance to
marginalization.

year. He was physically ready, he was

BY VICTOR BRADY
vbradyl@swarthmore.edu

As the rain finally began to lighten at
goaltender David
Clothier Field,
D'Annunzio 'l2 grabbed a header on goal
and held on as the final horn sounded on
a Swarthmore victory.
The No. 11
Swarthmore men's soccer team defeated
Franklin & Marshall by a score of 1-0 on
Saturday.
Returning home after a three-game
road trip and a game played in the cold
and steady rain all night, the Garnet held
the Diplomats at bay after a 16th minute
goal by Dylan Langley 'lO gave
Swarthmore the early lead.
That would be all that the home team
needed as Swarthmore controlled play
for the rest of the game and maintained a

strong back line even with the absence of
John Pontillo 'l3, a starter for most of the
season, who was battling flu-like symptoms and did not dress for the game.
Anchoring the Garnet defense was
Brett McLarney 'l2, who was named the
Centennial Conference Defensive Player
of the Week for his efforts against both
Franklin & Marshall and St. Mary's, who
Swarthmore defeated by a 1-0 margin on
the road Tuesday, Oct. 13.
"Brett has slid [into the defense] very
comfortably, having not played a whole
lot last year and starting out injured this

mentally ready, and technically and tactically we knew that [he] could play,"
head coach Eric Wagner said.
Working alongside proven stalwarts
Gage Newman 'll and Pierre Dyer 'l2,
McLarney has continued to develop and
thrive. "He dominates in the air, [and] he

dominates in the tackles. He is so fast
that nobody has been able to get around
him this year, and he has been making
better and better decisions each time
he's out there," Wagner added.
With the win, the Garnet improved to
13-1 on the year and 5-1 in Centennial
Conference play, completing a brutal
four-game stretch that included games at
non-conference opponents Richard
Stockton and St Mary's.
Wagner, who said two weeks ago that
he would be thrilled to get through the
next four games unscathed, was pleased
by his team's recent results. "It was a
very tough stretch for us, with three
road games in the middle of midterms,
and [this] part of the season is always
very difficult. For us to make it through
there unbeaten is just hard to believe,
but it shows the quality and the mettle of
our team," he said.
David Sterngold 'l2, who scored the
lone goal for the Garnet against St.
Mary's, recognizes the importance of getting through such an important stretch

of the schedule. "As the season goes on
our team gets worn down," Sterngold
said. "I think part of the difficulty we
experienced during this recent stretch
can be attributed to the accumulated
wear and tear of this season really catching up with us."
Still, Wagner is impressed by the ability that his team has shown to overcome
that wear and tear. "We have guys who
are pretty tough mentally, physically
tough, and obviously showing their talent when they need to
against some of
these teams, I think that we could have
played a little better. Are we playing our
best soccer? No. But we are grinding out
victories and grinding out results when
we need to."
The Diplomats succeeded in keeping
Morgan Langley 'll, the Centennial
Conference's leading scorer, from adding
to his 13 goals on the year. But in the 16th
minute, Newman blocked a shot from an
attacking Diplomat forward, with the
ball deflecting all the way out to Roberto
Contreras IV 'l2 in the midfield. After
splitting defenders across the centerline,
Contreras found Fabian Castro 'l2, who
sent the ball in to Dylan Langley.
Langley buried the ball on a blast inside
the right post, giving Swarthmore the 1-0
lead.
"When [a team keys on Morgan],
Dylan will score, or David will score. We
...

have had 13 or 14 guys this year who
have scored for us. I am not worried
about [our .opponent] shutting out one
player. They have to shut out all 1L"
Wagner said.
Sterngold would "love to win by playing nice, flowing soccer every game, but
it's important for us to be able to grind
out those types of victories as well."
Wagner agreed. "You don't give up a
lot of goals in conference. If you get a 1-0
victory, you've done extremely well,
regardless of whom you're playing or
where you're playing them. That's the
difference between a team like
Swarthmore and a team that might not
be so successful
we still manage to put
a goal in when we need to."
But with only three games to go, the
Garnet is poised to find a second wind
for the playoff push. "It's easier to find
that extra bit of energy and intensity the
closer we get to the post-season, because
everyone, in the back of their heads,
knows what's at stake." No Wednesday
game this week means more uninterrupted training, which Sterngold said is
crucial in maintaining focus for the next
couple weeks.
Swarthmore will next compete on the
road at McDaniel (7-6, 3-2 CC) this
Saturday at 1 p.m. The Garnet dismissed
the Green Terror by a score of 4-0 in a
meeting last year at Clothier Field.

candidate. Warning: this irrational prediction may be a result of a fascination
with gimmicky offenses, inexperienced
quarterbacks and outside linebackers
who dabble into ballroom dancing.
Reasons to Believe (or Doubt) the
Dolphins

One bleak Monday night in 2007, I
found myself watching the Dolphins and
Steelers struggle on a muddy Heinz Field
in the most uninspiring Monday Night
Football game ever played (final score: 30 Steelers). That season was magical for
the Dolphins. Magical is the only appropriate way of describing the team who
was a Cleo Lemon (Cleo who?) overtime
touchdown to Greg Camarillo (?!) away
from becoming the first NFL team to go 016 in the regular season (hello, Detroit
Lions!).

Two years later, the Dolphins are trying to recreate a differentkind of magic
the kind that helped them become the
2008 AFC East champions with an unexpected 11-5 record. I should have every
reason to believe that they won't be able
to recreate it.
The Dolphins have a win percentage
below .500 and are one and a half games
out of first place in the AFC East. Their
-

divisional opponents

have

talented

squads (Patriots quarterback Tom Brady
or the Jets' Rex Ryan defense, anyone?),
which means they have a small margin
for error. They face the strongest
"strength of schedule" in the NFL this
year (their 2009 opponents own a league
leading 2008 aggregate win percentage of
.594, and 6 of those teams reached the
playoffs). Their starting quarterback who
began the season, Chad Pennington
(reigning Comeback Player of the Year
who also ranked second in quarterback
rating), is out for the rest of the season
with a shoulder injury. Their wide
receivers have never caught more than
800 yards in a single season. Their current sack leader, Jason Taylor, is 35, and
wasn't even able to win Dancing with the

Stars.
I have every reason to give up on the
Miami Dolphins, but after watching them
dismantle the New York Jets in week five,

I won't.
Do I have any rational reasons to have
such blind faith in the Dolphins? First off,
after the five weeks of football, the team
has the same exact record this season as
they did last season. That year ended
with the team winning the division
(Sports Illustrated columnist Don Banks
noted that half of the teams that ended up
in the 2008 playoffs owned win percentages of .500 or lower after five weeks).
This year's Dolphins (who currently
boast a perfect divisional record) are
actually closer to catching the AFC East's
leading team.
Furthermore, the strength of their
opponents is overstated. Tom Brady is
showing signs of mortality this season
(e.g. he won't throw 50 TDs this season),
and the Jets' defense was ripped by the
'Fins in one of the more entertaining
Monday Night Football matches that I
have watched. The aggregate 2009 record
of their remaining opponents (as of week
5)?

A mediocre 22-3

L

The

transition

from

Chad

(Pennington, 80 NFL starts) to Chad
(Henne, 2 NFL starts) is going more
smoothly than most expected. Many
sports writers have actually speculated
that opponents must respect their vertical passing game more because of

Henne's stronger arm. But what about the
lack of playmakers at wide receiver and
on defense? And isn't the league adapting
to defend their wildcat offense? Anyone
who watched the Dolphins play the Jets
Monday night had to be impressed by the
success of the wildcat against a touted
defense. The Dolphins will constantly be
surprising opposing defenses with new
wrinkles to the wildcat, compensating for
whatever existing weaknesses on defense
and at wide receiver. At the very least,
which fan isn't entertained by watching a
running back throw a football or a wide
receiver run a reverse?
Dolphins MVP Talk
There are plenty of players on the
team's offense that have proved themselves after dealing with adversity, and
for this reason alone, the Miami Dolphins
are a feel-good story. Ricky Williams managed to overcome substance abuse to
become an integral cog in the wildcat

offense.
Chad Pennington lost his job as starting quarterback of the New York Jets last
year, only to find himself leading the
Dolphins into the playoffs by defeating
his former team. But no one has overcome his problems and become as integral a part of the Miami offense and identity as Ronnie Brown.
After two injury-riddled seasons,
Brown was able to help the team reach
the playoffs last year as the main piece in
the wildcat offense. This year, with an
inexperienced quarterback behind center
because of Pennington's injury, Brown's
job handling the offense has become even
more significant (note: Brown accounts

October 22, 2009

for about half of the Dolphin's touchdowns and touches the ball on most of
their offensive snaps).
He is a huge reason for the team's success, yet not many people consider him to
be an MVP candidate. Many believe quarterbacks like Peyton Manning and Drew
Brees to be the top candidates for the
award. ESPN's Mike Sando additionally
ranks Cedric Benson and Adrian
Peterson as the top running back candidates. Yet after the first five weeks of football, Brown had a similar number of
scrimmage yards and touchdowns as
Benson and Peterson, yet he isn't even
mentioned in Sando's top 10!
Brown's role in the offense is also
comparable to that of a quarterback.
When he runs the wildcat, Brown makes
the reads to decide whether he should
hand off the football or run it up the middle or around the edges. He also makes
passing decisions on option plays and
blocks for wide receivers on reverses.
Just like how defenses adjust their style
of play to match Peyton Manning's
prowess as a passer, defenses adjust their
style of play to match Brown's management of the wildcat. So why isn't Brown
comparable to the top candidates for the
MVP award?

Despite the lack of attention the Miami
Dolphins and Ronnie Brown are garnering this year from the general public,
they haven't failed to gain my attention.
Sports fans all have different reasons for
liking certain sport teams or players,
though some reasons are more rational
than others. Is it illogical for me to hope
that the Dolphins will make it into the
playoffs or that Brown will become an
MVP candidate? Maybe. But making irrational predictions for your favorite team
and hoping for a little magic is what being

a sports fan is all about.

The UFL may have more problems

moment that the UFL is essentially competing in a market that is completely saturated by the NFL. Up until this year,
football fans also had the Arena Football

but the economic downturn forced it to
cease operations, at least for the time
being. Since the season is so short, I find
it unlikely that the league will be able to
drum up a significant fan-base, or even a
requisite fan-base to keep the UFL running. Looking at game photos on the
league's website, it seems as though
there is almost nobody in the stands. Not
exactly the promising start that the
league founders may have hoped for.
However, there are some bright
spots for the UFL. Though their fourcolor uniform scheme (dominated by

Volleyball digs deep for record-setting victories
BY TIMOTHY BERNSTEIN
tbernstl@swarthmore.edu
Non-Centennial Conference teams, be
alert: Swarthmore is red-hot and doesn't
plan on overlooking you.
On Saturday, the Swarthmore volleyball
team found some time in between conference matches to sweep a tri-meet against
Rowan and Stevenson at Rowan University,
avoiding any type of letdown following a
tough stretch of conference matches.
The first match of the day, held at 11 a.m.,
couldn't have gone any more smoothly for
the Garnet (18-6, 6-1 CC) as they dispatched
the Rowan Owls in three games (25-22,25-19,
25-13) and appeared to gain momentum as
the match progressed, culminating in a
dominant performance in the third game.
Genny Pezzola 'l2 led the way with 10 kills
and 18 digs, spearheading a suffocating
Garnet defense that allowed only 26 Rowan
kills while tallying 91 total digs.

The afternoon match against the
Stevenson University Mustangs proved to
be a greater challenge, forcing the Garnet to
overcome a two-set deficit on the way to

their first five-set win of the season, taking
three of the five, with final scores of 20-25,
23-25, 25-14, 25-13 and 15-6.
Once again, Pezzola led the team with 30
digs and 13 kills. Setters Kearney Bangs 'lO
and Allie Coleman 'l3 combined for 30
assists as well.
Stevenson's Amy Rudolph led both

teams with 22 service aces, while fellow
Mustang Avery Gabbard led them with nine

kills.
"I'm very proud of our team coming back
the way we did," Pezzola said. "I think it
shows that we can come back from anything

and that we don't give up."
"The team is at a really exciting place in
the season right now," outside hitter
JohannaBond 'lO said. "This proves that we
can come back to win any match."
The victory was only the Garnet's second five-set match of the season, the first
coming in a loss to Johns Hopkins in which
the Garnet failed to hold a two-set lead."We
said to each other 'Let's do to [Stevenson]
what Hopkins did to us,'" Bond said, referring to the Hopkins comeback.
While the Garnet defense deserves
praise for stopping the Stevenson attack (33

points over the final three sets), Pezzola
indicated that another factor was key in

the team's turnaround.
"Over the fall break, we like to watch a
lot of movies together," Pezzola said, "and
in particular we watched 'Remember the
Titans,' including the locker-room scene
where the coach rallies the team at halftime. So in the middle of [the Stevenson
match], [outside hitter] Kat Montemurro
[l3] got all of us in a circle and gave us
this pep talk where she quoted the movie.
That definitely pumped all of us up and
made us ready to play."
Montemurro also contributed 12 kills
and three service aces, providing both
tangible and intangible support in the
win.
With the victories, Swarthmore
improves to 17-6 overall and 12-5 in nonconference play. Despite the fact that the
tri-meet did not count in the conference
standings, the Garnet refused to disregard the two teams they faced on
Saturday.
"We look at every game as a game we
need to win," Pezzola said. "While the
non-conference matches give us an opportunity to prepare for conference games,
we knew that we needed to go out there
[on Saturday] and play hard."

Indeed, the Garnet is just taking it one
game at a timefor now, albeit with an eye
on several upcoming big games, including
road matches at Gettysburg on Oct. 24 and
Haverford on Oct. 28.
"We still have some of the toughest
games of the season ahead of us," Bond

said.

Last night, the Garnet continued its
impressive run, winning its record sixth
Centennial Conference game, crushing
Ursinus (8-14, 2-6 CC) at Tarble Pavilion
by a score of 3-0 (25-15, 25-14, 25-19). The
match also marked Swarthmore's participation in the annual Dig For The Cure

fundraiser for breast cancer research, in
which pledged donations were collected
for each of the 91 digs.

The Garnet hopes to continue its intraconference success Saturday, when they
travel to Gettysburg (16-7, 5-2 CC), to compete with the team that has handed the
Garnet straight-set losses the past two
seasons. Game time is set for 1 p.m.
