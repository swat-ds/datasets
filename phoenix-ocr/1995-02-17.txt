SWARTHMORE COLLEGE

Debaters Win
North American

SWARTHMORE, PENNSYLVANIA

February 17, 1995

Championship
By Julie Falk
Last weekend, JeremyMallory '95
and Neal Potischman '95 captured
the North American Debate Championship, becoming the first United
States team ever to win the contest.
Their success means Swarthmore
now hold two of the world's three
most important debate trophies.
Mallory and Potischman also placed
13th at the World Debate Championships last month, ranking higher than
all other American college teams at
that tournament.
About 60 teams competed in the
fourth annual North American tournament, held at the University of
Pennsylvania.
Mallory and Potischman emerged
from thepreliminary rounds withfive
wins and one loss. In the quarterfinals
they defeateda team from Hart House
(Toronto, Canada) on a 4 -1 decision.
Mallory and Potischman advanced to
the finals after defeating Princeton's
A team in round which granted them
a decisive 6-1 victory.
In the final round, the team from
Swarthmorefaced another team from
Hart House. When the Canadian team
won a coin toss and chose to take the
opposition, Mallory and Potischman
were forced to debate in favor of the
proposition, "President Clinton
should not have involved himself in
the major league baseball strike."
Potischman said that, although the
Canadian team did not know a lot

about this topic, "they got what they
bargained for" as it is easier to win
the opposition side than the Government (or affirmative) side. Before the
final rebuttals, floor speeches given
by the House, those watching the
round, heavily favored the Canadian
team. Entering the rebuttal speeches,

Mallory and Potischman were losing
by a wide margin. The vote wasclose,
but the outcome was all -10 decision
in favor of Swarthmore.
"The head of the Canadian group
picked us to win and that's as close as
you get to Las Vegas in the debating
world," said Potishman. "I told Jeremy if we make it through the quarters round I think we'll win."
Swarthmore's Peaslee Debate Society has done tremendously well in
the past few years, recovering from a
dry spell in which Swarthmore teams
rarely advanced to semifinalsrounds.
Mallory notes thatmany strong frosh
and sophomores this year have stuck
with the team and foresees the society continuing to do well. Mallory
considers that the new attitude of
regarding debate at Swarthmore as a
society, rather than a team has given
the members new strength.
Mallory and Potischman wanted
to end their debating career victoriously, and decided that they will no
longer debate at tournaments. However, if these stellar debaters give an
exhibition debate at Swarthmore in
the spring all should come out to
observe.

Investigation of

Fire Continues
By Melissa L. Jacobs
During the past two weeks, the
Swarthmore campushas beenruffled
by a rash of small fires and alarms.
The first, on February 2, occured in
Old Tarble. The second was a leaf
fire behind Parrish on February 9.
Early last Friday morning students
were roused from their rooms in
Parrish due to a fire which had begun
in the Old Bookstore. And most recently, firefighters arrived on campus in response to student reports of
smoke in the CD section ofWharton.
While this most recent response to
fire proved unnecessary, it indicates
the campus' heightened sensitivity

threats of fire.
The Wharton incident occurred late
Monday evening. Two fire companies arrived at the scene to investigate the presence of smoke in response to a call from a student to
Public Safety. Firefighters quickly
discovered no cause for alarm. Stuto

dents were not evacuated from the
dormitory. Numerousmembersof the

CD community attribute the smoke
smell to incense burning ina student's
room on the second floor. Owen
Redgrave of Public Safety said the
cause of the smell of smoke was more
likely as result of the wind carrying
the smoke from a fire place, as frequently occurs in cold weather and as
a result of the College's position on
the hill.
The urgent response to the smells
of smoke in Wharton was a result of
Public Safety's recent change in the

policy of its campus fire response
system, as a direct result of last
Thursday's Parrish fire. Redgrave
saidthat a "box alarm" system, under
which seven fire companies will respond directly to fire alarms, has been
established. The companies are:
Swarthmore, Springfield, Media,
South Media, Rutledge, NetherProvidence, and GardenCity. On the night
of the Wharton incident, four fire
companies were recalled once the

first fire companies to arrive had surveyed the extent of the threat of fire.
The fire response system which
had been in place previously had campus security investigate the cause for
alarm before sending out for outside
support. This confirmation system
was designed to reduce the number
offalse or minor alarms that extended beyond the immediate campus
community. Redgrave explained that
the new policy is designed to be "extra careful and get faster response."
This policy does not increase the
threat of false alarms as thedetectors
in students' rooms are for the most
part equipped with a dual detection
system which responds only in the
room if it detects smoke, but throughout the entire building inresponse to
heat. This system reduces false
alarms. On the night of the Wharton
incident, two room detectors were set
off in Willets as people were popping
popcorn. Naturally, fire companies
did not respond.
Suspicions that the fires were a
result of arson continue to be unresnlvp.H

Student Council's Closed
Meeting Policy Under Fire
By Erik Huneke

Veronica Green '95 and Tanisha
Little '97 tested a ban on public attendance of some StudentCouncil meetings on Sunday night, when they tried
to sit in on a closed session.
"The whole point for us going up
there...was to make a point about
rules... and not operating under a constitution," said Green. Little said that
it's "not to say thatcertain people are
definitely wrong in what they are
doing." She and Green instead intended to challenge aspects of SC's
structure and practice. They want the
College to re-examine the practice of
closes SC meetings.
Student Council Co-Coordinator
Margaret Cohen '96 said that Green
and Little came in as "silent observers" but then joined the conversation
as to whether or not they should be
allowed to remain in the meeting.
Because Green and Little refused
to leave the meeting to allow members to discuss whether to allow them
to stay for the rest of the meeting, a
proposal which had been put forth by
SC member Seth Harvey '97, Cohen
and Co-Coordinator Mike Pan '97
adjourned the meeting.
Cohen felt she was not "blindly

following tradition in keeping Sunday meetings closed" because "before we bring something to the student body, logistics have to be dis-

cussed." She also said that the presence ofother members of the student
body would not be helpful when issues are raised which are "sensitive
to certain individuals and groups," or
when charters for new organizations
are being considered or people interviewed for appointments. Cohen asserted that neither she, any other
members of SC nor the student body
should"become the arbiter ofwhether
an organization is valuable" if there
is demonstrated interest in it.
Harvey, on the other hand, felt that
students should be able to see which
charters are approved because their
Student Activities Funds are used to
support them. He believed that keeping Sunday meetings closed reduces
the level of communication that
should exist between SC and other

"If we don't have the
mechanisms for openness, how can
students be expected to be interested
in their government?" He said that
for SC to be truly accountable to the
students who elect it, students should
be able to judge whether it "represents the student body in an unbiased, impartial way" and that SC
members should therefore not be
"afraid to say something in front of
someone [they] might know."
Cohen did not feel that closing
such meetings makes SC members
less accountable to the student body,
since "any member of the community is free to get in touch" with SC
members about their questions and
concerns at any time. 'The Sunday
night meeting isn't one of those channels of communication," she said.
Green and Little's other grievance is the fact that SC does not
operate under a ratified constitution.
Harvey concurred, saying that without a constitution, "nothing you will
do will have validity because everything you do can be challenged."
Several drafts of the constitution
exist. Pan andCohen presided over a
committeelast semester which eliminated outdated provisions and instudents.

corporated such recent innovations
as electronic voting into a new draft.
Cohen said that "it's difficult to
understand...the time it takes to go
through constitution drafts" and that
SC has been operating without a
constitution for at least the past five
years. Both Cohen and Pan agree
there is a need for written rules and
structure, but they disagree with the

suggestion that SC should disband

until a new constitution is ratified.
Harvey, who is chairing this
semester's constitution committee,
has set March 18 as the date by
which he intends to complete this
process of ratification. He felt it is

imperative that the Council cease to
"do [things] on a case-by-case basis."
Among these matters was a recent
controversy surrounding the applica-

tionof Justin Herring '97, an SC mem-

ber, to be a member of the Budget

Committee.
In the first vote on this matter, SC
decided not to let Herring sit on both
councils. After an appeal was made
against this decision, Herring was allowed to serve on both theBC and SC
because there was no explicit rule
against it. Cohen said this was justified since Herring had not participated in meetings or voted after the
initial discussion. She added that because both current and past SC members have served on the two committees, sitting on both seemed acceptable. Cohen commented, "By making
it one of the various committees that
operates under SC," it does not seem
reasonable to expect membership in
each to be mutually exclusive.
Cohen viewed it as "highly unlikely" that the many people would
occupy positions on both Student

Council and Budget Committee, and
thought that having some members in
common "keeps up the communica-

tion" between the two groups.
Harvey saw the turmoil during the
first few weeks of SC as theresult of
the need for members to recognize
that, unlike in the past, consensus was
not always

reached. He felt that "it's
important that we all agree on things,
but it's not a necessity." As part of
this process, Little, Green, and five
SC members decided toset up a meeting in which members of the student
body will be able to express their
concerns about SC's procedures and
mechanisms of accountability. Yet
Harvey regrets that the members
reached no real conclusions; he cannot imagine "what we woulddo if this
happens again next week."

Public Safety is making substantial efforts to boost fire security and
awareness on campus. These include
a coordinated effort with Donald
Abramowitz, the campus' Occupational and Environmental Safety Officer "to identify and eliminate fire
hazards," for example keeping hallways free from obstacles, and insuring that fire exits are illuminated.
Public Safety is also working with
Swarthmore's Fire Marshall to put
together a fire safety training program in the spring to coincide with
the spring set of fire drills. Members
of the borough fire company have
been visiting the campus to familiarize themselves with the buildings.
Redgrave encourages members of
the college community "to pay close
attention to fire alarms, especially
until we get a handle on this. It's
important that people pay close attention and evacuate the buildings."
He went on to emphasize the impor-

of making the buildings safe
environments by keeping doors
locked and closed, and reporting any
suspicious activity.
tance

sure that we will get all the credits we
would get at Swarthmore."
Piker agreed that this is a pressing
concern. He asserted that it is impossible for the College to guarantee

credit for programs undertaken anywhere other than Swarthmore,
Haver ford, Bryn Mawr, or the University of Pennsylvania. However,
he said, judging from the fact that all
programs that students have attended
in the recent past have been acceptable, "you will have de facto assurance, though de jure assurance cannot be given, since all credit must
first be approved by the Swarthmore
faculty."
"I am now quite confident—although the rule has not changed and
so far as I know it will not change—that the program of foreign study is
so well developed, because we know
how to choose programs and prepare
students for programsbefore they go,
that we will be able to give credit to

all students for foreign study programs upon their return," he added.
When asked by Marybeth

Lenkevich '95, why room and board
are included in the price, Piker said
that Swarthmore would be paying
those expenses for the time in the
foreign study program.
Amy Dalton '9B questioned why
room and board are automatically

included in the fee when students
here have the option of living off
campus and saving thatmoney; Piker
responded that that question had not
been considered in committee meetings.
Students were also concerned over
the lack of student consultation in
making this decision. Seth Harvey
'97 asked why there had been little
student input. Piker said that the studentrepresentatives on Budget Committee were consulted, and that this
was standard College procedure for
administrative decisions.

Housing Committee
Plans Blocks, Sub-Free
Halls for Next Year
By Tara Zahra
The housing committee made a
series of recommendations Monday
on crucial housing issues including
substance-free halls and blocks. Many
of the decisions made were clearly
aimed at making the room choosing
process less chaotic and ripe for abuse
than it was last year.
Despite rumors to the contrary,
there will be either two or three substance-free halls next year, depending on the number of interested students who attend a meeting to be held

before the regular room draw. All
students considering living on subfree halls should plan on attending
this meeting, as rules for sub-free
housing will be drawn up at that time.
Likely substance-free halls are Dana
lower level, Mertz third north and
Mertz third south.

The committee also determined
that the procedure for choosing sub
free rooms will be slightly different
this year. Students will no longer
enter a separate room draw. Rather,
sub-free spaces will be available at
regular room draw with regular lottery numbers. Thus, while attendance
at thesub-free meeting is not mandatory or binding, it is advisable that
any student interested in sub-free

housing show up so that enough
rooms are allocated.
At least one sophomore who currently lives in sub-free housing
doesn't believe that the changes will
make a difference.'The new system
won't affect my decision of whether
or not to go sub-free. I'm more concerned with which halls are available," said Alison Schirmer '97, a
resident ofWillets lower level, which
is currently substance-free.
Later on inMonday's housing committee meeting, a subcommittee on
block housing suggested that 60
blocks be made available this year.
The blocks will range in size from 2
to 7 beds.
While the proposed 60 blocks is
significantly less than the 130 that
were available last year before block
housing was dissolved, it will be the

largest number of blocks ever implemented. The previous high was 50.

Sophomore committeemember Matt
Sosland said, "We tried to fill the
high demand for blocks that led to
last year's changes while acknowledging and adjusting for last year's
problems."
The committee hopes that class
and gender restrictions will prevent
some of last year's problems from
recurring.

College Discloses Price Tag
of New Honors Program
Examiners to recieve $lOOO, $7OO more than before
By Sam Schulhofer-Wohl

The revised format ofexternal examinations under the new Honors
program will cost the College about
$70,000 a year in additional payments to outside examiners, according to Provost Jennie Keith.
"The program is really a part of the
College's identity. If we have to, if
there are costs to supporting this pro gram, we're going topay them,"Keith
said.
In the new program, external examiners will review a wide range of
Honors students' work, including
papers and projects, and assign essays and problem sets in addition to
the traditionaloral and written tests.
The 100 examiners who participate in the program each year will
receive $lOOO apiece, up from the
$3OO they earn now, for doing the
extra work, according to Keith. She

anticipates that in the short term the
College will not need to hire more
examiners, because many examiners
now test only one or two students,
and could easily evaluate more.
Keith said grants, donations and
discretionary curriculum support
funds from the President's and
Provost's budgets will cover the
higher cost during the first four years
of the program. At the end of that
period, the College will review the
new program; if it becomes permanent, additional money will be allocated in the annual College-wide
budget.
The extra cost is roughly comparable to the average total salary and
benefits paid to an associate professor. Keith emphasized, however, that
paying it would not mean losing a
faculty member. "These are not
tradeoffs that involve the commitment of ongoing funds," she said.

Keith said the changed examination formats would make the Honors
program accessible to a wider range
of students.
"The goal in giving departments
and programs very wide options in
defining formats of preparation for
external exams is to ensure that students in every field will be able to
stand for Honors if they choose, including those in Engineering," she
wrote in a letter to an alumnus last
month.

"Part of the worry [that prompted
revision of the program] was not just
the numbers [of students involved],
but the very skewed distribution.Students couldn't participate in many
departments," Keith explained in an
interview. 'The three-hour written
exam format doesn't work for studio
arts or performing arts, for example."
The new program takes effect with
the class of 1997.

Swat To Replace Computer Database IC Series
New System Could Permit On-Line Registration for Classes
By Sam Schulhofer-Wohl
AIMS, the College's 15-year-old
computerized database, has grown

forgetful and out-of-date, and the
College is in the market for new
software to keep track of everything
from transcripts to paychecks to
alumni records.
"There are lots of things thatdon't
work with the old [system]. It's now
at the point where it consistently
makes errors, and that's no way to
keep academic records," said Registrar Jane Mullins. The mistakes including dropping courses from transcripts, and, according to some
sources, listing alumni as dead when
they are alive and well.
The computer that the database
runs on works fine; the software is
what's broken.
Members of CIMS, the task force
charged with selecting a new database program, said that besides preventing the errors, new software will
make it easier to investigate trends in
grading, students' choices of majors,
and other areas.

"It is very important that we have
a system that will do this kind of
research more easily," said chemistry professor Tom Stephenson, a
member of the task force. "One of the
problems with the existing software
is that you're highly restricted as to
the data you can get out and the form
you can get it in."
The new software program could
also make dreams of computerized
course registration a reality. But
Mullins, a CIMS committee member, warned, "Don't hold your
breath." She said her office would
need a larger staffand more computers to organize on-line registration.
"There are people who like the

face to face contact at registration,"
Stephenson added. "It's hard to replace that kind of feedback with a
computer terminal. It's just a question of, from a policy point of view,
will we be going to do that?"
Fully computerized registration is
not possible with the old system because it did not originally include a
registration program, and the College does not have a staff ofprogrammers who can make the necessary
changes and maintain the system.
The old database gradually deteriorated because the company that
wrote the database program went

bankrupt, leaving the College with
nowhere to turn for help when problems developed or procedural changes

forced modifications in the software.
Swarthmore joinedtwo consortia that
were formed for collaborationamong
colleges trying to upgrade and maintain AIMS. But according to college
administrators, both groups soon

failed.
"It is increasingly a burden to keep
[the system] up to date," said Glenn
Stauffer, the Computing Center staff
member who runs the database.
"AIMS as a software package no
longer has a vendor. You have a
choice— either you do it yourself
and maintain a programming staff, or

you find another product that has
support from thesoftware developer."
The College chose the second alternative and charged CIMS (College Information Management System), a new 33-member task force,
with selecting a new database program. The committee has narrowed
the options to two software vendors,
SCT and Datatel; it will make a final
decision by June 1, said Judy Downing, Director ofComputingand Communication Services.

Representatives fromCarleton and
Welleslcy colleges have visited
Swarthmore to discuss their experiences with new database systems,
Downing said. 'The vendors will
come for three days each [later this
spring] to demonstrate their software."
During the fall, the task force,
which includes representatives from
every administrative office as well as
two faculty members, compiled long
lists of questions to ask the software
vendors. In the process, it re-evaluated the record keeping procedures
in place now.
"You want to be careful that you
don't ask a new system to produce
everything in the same way as before," Mullins explained. "You want
it to do what you want. What we've
done is write out a whole series of
every question we can think of— not
what will it do or not do that it does
now, but how it will do so-and-so."
According to Stephenson, the com-

mittee will spend next year planning
a three-year process in which functions of the old database will gradually be transferred to the new one.
Actual work with the new system and
its software will not begin until the
summer of 1996. "We're not going to
change over in a day," Stephenson
said.
Downing estimated that the total
cost of converting to the new database could be as high as $1 million.
The figure covers the costs of the new
software, a new computer that may
be needed to run it, training College
staff to use the new system, salaries
for staff members who will carry out
the conversion, and converting data
from the old format to one that the
new system can use.

Opinions
Harrassment: Sex vs. Socialization Closed for a Reason
that appear suggestive to one person seem innocent to
another.
We need to solve this communication problem, because people are getting hurt. Ought we enforce policies
mandating which words may and mat not be said, to
whom, under what circumstances, in what tone of voice,
and with what accompanying body language? Or instead, ought we manufacture products that flash our
indications like roadblock signals?
Both of these options are infeasible. In the realm of
human behavior, no policy can even approach addressing all the possible situations. As for the "Flasher," not
even the author of the article took it seriously. Even the
general idea of signaling systems is contrived—special
code words and signs often feel too removed from our
lives to have any bearing on our present situation.
What is needed is a standard upon which all of us can
judgeour social interactions. We need common, refined
socialization, instilled in us from a very young age. That
way, everyone would have a deeply internalized, shared,
fair set of expectations. We could then become responsible for our own actions and would not feel violated,
because we would understand the interactions.
What we need, it seems, are standards of behavior that
are taught from parent to child and develop within the
safe family. With respect and dignity, we are able to treat
each other civilly. This is our best hope, and no policy or
gadget can replace it.
—Tamar Charry

Like the song says, Let's talk about sex, baby.
Sexual harassment, that is.
Two articles in the February 14 issue of ThePhiladelphia Inquirer illustrate an alarming trend. They
indicate that in interpersonal relations, we are moving
away from common sense and personal responsibility.
They indicate that socialization is on the decline.
The first, on page one, reports that middle schools
and high schools are now following the lead of businesses and universities in paying increased attention to
incidents of harassment, and are devising policies to
punish offenders.The article cites severalincidents and
policies from schools around the area.
The second article, on page Gl, is more of a grabber
(pun intended). It is about a new gadget, called "The
Harasser Flasher." It's shaped like a miniature traffic
light The deal is, if you're a woman, you pin it to your
lapel, and then you go to a bar and talk to men. If one is
coming on to you and you don'tlike him, you turn it to
red. If you think he's cool, you turn it to green. It is
intended to facilitate discourse. The article quotes its
inventor as saying, "I envisioned the average office
worker saying, 'I can use this to subtly let people know
what I think.'"
..To let people know whatyou think. That does seem
to be the heart of the sexual harassment issue. Most—not all, but most—incidents of harassment occur because a man and a woman do not understand each
other's intentions. Comments, clothing and gestures

Letters to the Editor
CAX and the
Bookstore Display
To the Editors:

In response to MichaelBrus' s opinion in last week's Phoenix I foundhis
judgments of the Coalition Against
Xenophobia's bookstore display case

misguided.
Michael argued that our display
oversimplified: that it glossed over
distinctions between Proposition 187
and the historical episodes portrayed;
that it tarred all supporters of 187
with a too-widebrush of xenophobia.
Acknowledging—as I don't think
Michael did—that no display window can adequately present complex
political and historical arguments, I
want to explain why the point we
hoped to make in our showcase was
an important and appropriate one.
Michael was quite right to call the
display "CAX-inspired." The name
and the mission statement of the Coalition AgainstXenophobia make clear
that it does not exist simply to oppose
Proposition 187,but to identify, condemn and work against the anti-foreign prejudices that the bill, in the
name of protecting American interests, exploits and perpetuates. I and
others in CAX believe that bringing
this critical perspective to bear is an
important task in itself. Sensitizing
ourselves to the xenophobic implications of what may seem purely selfhelping legislation encourages us to
examine with care the motives and
results of national policy. It reminds
us that many economic and social
"advances" also bear human costs,

and that "national interest" can involve chauvinism.
Our central goal in assembling the
display window was to turn this critical glance on American history as
well. We specifically highlighted the
bigotry that characterized events like
the Palmer raids and the JapaneseAmerican internment, which were in
their time considered measures of
national protection and not anti-foreign. The point was not to conflate
but to juxtapose, to provoke reflection on the commonalities ofpast and
present events. The conviction that
our nation's stability is threatened by
criminals and freeloaders (illegal, or
even legal, immigrants) is not so different from the conviction that the
threat comes from Bolsheviks and
anarchists (Russians, Jews, and foreigners). Are different dynamics at
work in 1919 and 1994? Certainly,
and they are worth discussing; I don't
think the bookstore window, which
documented the featured episodes
with original news articles, suppressed their variety. But it is wrong
to claim that "historical xenophobia," simply because it's recognized
as such today, is essentially different
from current and disputed initiatives
like Proposition 187.
The kind of comparison our display undertook does not seem to me
"exaggerated," and the insights to be
gained from it are considerable—that is, if we take the time to consider
them. It is easy to take up arms for or
against the "moral equivalency" of
two events; it is more difficult, but of
course more fruitful, to reflect on
their common features. Our display
was not intended to be the final word

Canon Redux
To the Editors:

I noted Tamar Charry's full formula for identifying "traditional"
courses in the English department in
the Feb. 10 issue of ThePhoenix.
Charry writes that "traditional"
courses list "primarily, pre-20th Century writings in the Courses Catalog,
and propose to study them intact."

What exactly is meantby this puzzling criteria? I am rather curious
about how one leaves a text "intact"
and thus safely traditional.
What is this mysterious method?
Does it simply consist of sitting
around a classroom and agreeing that
a particular text was really good?
Wouldn't any kind of more detailed
analysis or critique of a text consist
of leaving it less than intact? Which
literary critics past or present have
kindly left texts "intact?"
I await further explanations ofMs.
Charry's methodology with some
interest.

was interrupted by two students who
wanted to observe the closed Student

The students argued that they
should be permitted to stay on the
grounds that Student Council has no
ratified constitution and therefore no
writtenrule specifying that the Sunday meeting be closed. When they
expressed this opinion, we attempted
to convey to them that, while there
may be no current documentation to

After the meeting was officially adjourned, several
members of Council, along
with the two students, remained to further explain
and clarify Council's position on the matter.

addressed was that of the

ining old drafts of the constitution

Because we realize the importance
an organized forum for student
dialogue, Student Council has open
meetings on Thursday nights in
Parrish Parlors.
While it is unfortunate that the
meeting on Sunday was cut short due
to this unexpected intrusion, this semester, strides have been made to
improve communication between Student Council, its subcommittees and
the student body. To this end, an open
forum was held in which committee
members updated Council and members of the studentbody as to progress
in each of their respective commit-

and preparing the final draft for ratification.
One of the main arguments of the

students was that Student Council is functioning improperly because
of a lack of structure and written
rules. We would like to respond that
Constitution Committee's express
purpose is the expeditious ratification of a set of writtenrules.
Furthermore, to the best of our
knowledge, Student Councilhas not
had a ratified constitution in at least
five years, according to past Student
Council members. In light of this,
this semester's Council, following
the lead of last semester's, formed
the Constitution Committee to address this problem.
This Student Council, for the first
time in recent history, is tackling the
problem of a lack of a ratified constitution.This information is available
in the minutes of meetings which can
befound both on the StudentCouncil
bulletin board and on two news
groups on Newswatcher (_swat.announce.general and _swat.org.sc).
Questions about the status of the constitution can be directed to members
of the constitution committee.
The second issue addressed was
the closed nature of Sunday night
meetings. We would like to clarify
the reasoning behind why we have
both open and closed meetings. Sunday night meetings are the forum in
which the student elected members

We plan to continue and improve
effective communication between all
these groups. One way in which we
hope to accomplish this is by having
a bulletin board displaying the names,
members, goals, and current topics in
each committee.
We feel that the interruption of the

Sunday night meeting was due to a
lack of complete information. The
attacks of the two students were unfounded, disruptive, and counterproductive to the fulfillmentof our elected
obligations. In the future, we hope
that students find better means to express their opinions.
It is our hope that misunderstandings like this one can be avoided
through better channels of communication and that any future grievances
can be brought to Student Council in
a more respectful manner.

Two Saturdays ago I attended the classic basketball
matchup between Swarthmore College and Haverford
College. What I ended up seeing was a wrestling match
between intoxicated Haverford and Swarthmore students. The problem as I saw it was threefold: Haverford
students were allowed to sit in the designated Swarthmore stands, Haverford security was permitting visibly

intoxicated students to enter the gymnasium, and no
effort was made to separate the groups of students after an
initial shoving match erupted. Had any one of the
aforementionedactionsbeen taken, the final melee would
have been avoided.
I hope Swarthmore learns from Haverford's mistakes
and adequately prepares for future events.

A Student's Brief on Security
The Department

of Public Safety Needs Support to Accomplish Mission

By David Sobel

A funny thing happened to me a
few weeks ago. I needed to go up to
the Student Publications room on
Parrish sth. For those of you not
involved in publications, thisroom is
usually left locked and a silent alarm
guards the door. Until last week, that

alarm was broken—there was no way
to turn it off. When one entered the
room, one would have to call security
to tell themthat a thief was not stealing all the computers and that official
business was being conducted.
I had some business to conduct
that Sunday night. I acquired the key
to the room, went upstairs, entered
the room, and called security. I told
them my name, my position on the
paper, and my phone number. This
was not the first time I had made this
phone call, so I expected everything
to be all right.

no-nonsense—good traits for the
head of campus security.
No matter how good our head of
security is, however, it is not possible to improve safety measures at

Swarthmore without the administration's taking some of the proposals ofmembers of the community
more seriously.
With all the security related events
of the past year that have occurred—computers being stolen out of Mertz
and Hallowell, muggings outside
Parrish, and the recent fires in Old
Tarble and Parrish—security has
come under criticism lately. Perhaps
the blame for what seems like security's incompetency is not their inability to keep the campus safe, but
the administration's lack of financial support for the necessary precautions and the adminstration's refusal to believe that there is a safety
problem in our quaint little society
tucked away in

With all the security related
events of the past year that have
occurred security has come under criticism lately.
My work took about fifteen minI left the room and went home.
About twenty minutes later I received
a phone call from a security officer.
"Don't you know how to enter a
room without setting an alarm off?"
was the first question he asked me.
After a brief conversation about why
I was on Parrish sth, and how the
alarm for the door was broken and
had been broken since the beginning
of the semester, I was toldthat everything was OK, but got what seemed
like verbal abuse.
The next morning, I received a call
from Owen Redgrave. We spoke
about fixing the alarm for the room. It
was the second time I've spoken to
Mr. Redgrave in the last year. The
first time was after my computer was
stolen out of my Hallowell single last
spring. In both conversations, I
thought he was honest, straight, and
utes.

on

campus and, as
the recent fire
call outside
Wharton suggests, now taking advantage of the campus' paranoia
about fire. Earlier this year, someone
was waiting for students to walk alone
at night in order to take their money
and threaten their lives. Last year,
someone may have been watching
your room in order to take your computer while you were in class or even
in the bathroom. Watching your

room!
What can be done about this?
Locking doors to dorms 24 hours a
day goes against the College's philosophy of an open community. The
inability of a vehicle to travel from
the Rose Garden to the west end of
Parrish without leaving the campus
makes setting up manned security
gates at the campus's entrances im-

practical, as well as costly. Adding
phones around campus and at dorm
entrances would probably translate

intorewiring the already too complex
phone system.
But these changes would make
Swarthmore more safe. Most importantly, increasing the size and organizational level of the security force,
including some way of keeping track

of whether the alarm on Parrish sth
was broken, would increase security's
effectiveness on campus.
I'm not an expert in campus security, but I know that security can only
do so much with the resources it has
been given. The officers who patrol
this campus are human beings and
sometimes fallible. As students, we
often forget that. What we should not

forget is that the responsibility of
keeping this campus safe is not only
on Owen Redgrave's shoulders, but
also on ourselves and the administration.
Last week, The Garnet Patrol
brought students into the fray. Now
it's the administration's turn.

Behind the Scenes with Student Council
By Lisa Hibler

Student Council is elected to repthe student body, yet most
students on campus are unaware of
decisions the council makes. Yield
is low in council elections each
semester, indicating that students

that reflect current student concern.
"We're there to serve students,"
Cohen said of SC. "If students aren't
telling us what they want done then
we're really at a loss."
SC serves an important role as
intermediary between the students
and the administration, letting the

either aren't interested in or don't
fully understand the voting process.

concerns

resent

Council member Jennifer Hayoun
said, "We realize that we're not
viewed as integral to the student
body."
She added that SC is working to
improve communication with students and does encourage students'
feedback in a number of ways; SC
needs such feedback if it is to function as an "integral" part of the student body.
The Council meets twice weekly.
Sunday nights they hold a closed
session, for council members only,
beginning at 8:30 p.m. Thursday
meetings, also beginning at 8:30
p.m. are open to the entire student
body. Thursday meetings are held in
Parrish Parlors, and students are
always invited to come and offer
input. This Thursday's meeting was
canceled because of the talk by
Spike Lee and Julie Dash, but the
previous Thursday was spent talking
about the new Honors program.
Provost Jennie Keith and Assistant
Provost Mark Jacobs attended the
meeting to discuss the past history
and current format of the Honors
program; between 40 and 50 students attended.
Council co-coordinator Margaret
Cohen '96 said that SC tries to
choose "timely issues" as topics for
the Thursday night meetings, issues

administration know about student
and informing students

about administrative issues. The
Council coordinators meet once a
week with Assistant Dean Fernando
Chang-Muy and once a month with
Dean Ngina Lythcott to inform them
of student concerns. To keep students informed, SC posts its minutes
on the board across from the mail
room in Parrish and also on
Newswatcher. All Council votes are
now open votes, which means that
students can read in the council minutes who voted for which issues and
decide whether the students they
elected are adequately representing

their views.
SC deals with a variety of issues.
Council charters new organizations;
last Sunday two new organizations
presented charter requests: a SelfDefense club and a Puppetry club.
SC also discusses policy issues that
affect the student community. For
example, last Sunday they voted that
student council members are eligible for a Budget Committee position. Previously, they had been
voted non-eligible. A large issue for
SC right now is the debate over allcampus email; SC is the only organization left with authorization to
send all-campus mailings, and it has
been receiving many requests from
other organizations to send out mailings. They are currently trying to

establish criteria for the mailings
as
member Tony
Cheesebrough '97 commented, "We
don't want to be pegged as a discriminatory body."
One area over which SC does not
have jurisdiction is the actions of the
various campus committees, but it is

because,

currently working on ways to open

communication between the committees and SC so that SC can better
serve as a liaison between the committees and the student body.
Committee appointments are underway, and the 6 members of SC who
form the Appointments sub-committee are reading applications and
conducting interviews to decide
upon
committee membership.
chair
Appointments
Tony
Cheesebrough '97 reported Sunday
that all appointments had been filled
except the Budget and Orientation
committees.
This year, Cheesebrough is planning on enforcing this year a rule
that has always been written in SC
policy, that committees report back
to council each month on their current activities. SC will then list the
committees and what they are doing
on the SC board in Parrish to keep
students informed. This will update
students on committee decisions.
For example, the Council on
Educational Policy is currently
working with Provost Jennie Keith
to make course evaluations mandatory for all professors. No decision
has been reached at present, but by
posting updates such as this on the
SC board, students will be encouraged to read about it and then voice
satisfaction or dissatisfaction over
committee decisions to SC, which

will then take appropriate action.
Co-coordinator Mike Pan '97
feels that SC has the potential to be
a more effective agent of change. He
cited that fact that council is young
this year; there are no seniors, only 2
juniors and, the remaining 12 members are Sophomores and Firstyears. Pan feels that Council is "definitely more energetic than in past

years." If students are "motivated,"
then SC can work with them and
with the administration to incur
changes, just as it did last semester
with the proposed Journalism
course, now a reality. Pan said that,
given a "legitimate cause to take

action" Council should be able to
"put together a solution" and that the
Journalism course epitomizes this
process.

Dean Fernando Chang-Muy said
he has been "immensely
impressed with the work of the
Student Council" during his one and
that

a half years here. He felt that a few
slight changes would work to make

council even more effective. He
suggested that one of the two coordinators be a lay-over from a previous semester, explaining, 'This
allows for continuity." He went on
to say, "It's difficult, though not
impossible, to carry out and contin-

ue work started last semester, this
if one is working with new

semester,

personalities." Another suggestion
was somehow to implement a system "as representative as possible"
for example residence hall representatives to council.
Member Tony Cheesebrough '97
feels that the current council is a
"fair group as far as representation
goes" and that a larger group would

not be more effective. He is in his
fourth semester as council member
and said that over the years "[The]

group dynamic has changed the
most." He described the atmosphere
in this year's council as one of "tension" and said that it has been harder to reach consensus on issues. This
could be because the group is
diverse and its members sticks
strongly to their varied viewpoints.
Retired council coordinator Andy
Feldman '96 described his overview
of Council: "Swarthmore's Student
Council has been becoming more
and more active during the past few
semesters. Now it needs to improve
public relations by making students
aware of what the group is working
on and what they have accomplished. If the Council continues to
be an active body, and if the school
knows this, students will then bring

their own concerns and ideas to the
Council. Only then is it a truly representative body."
Student council is a representative body. As with any representative body, the population it is representing has the right to voice criti-

cism . and concern and to demand
awareness of the issues being
addressed. The Council co-coordinators urge students to become
involved in Council this semester.
Thursday meetings are always open
meetings and students can also send
email, phone messages or campus
mail to any of the council members.
All of the names, addresses and
numbers are listed on the council
board. Students are also encouraged
to vote and to run themselves for
Council because new voices are
always important.

We may spend only four years
here, but George's family has been
affiliated with the College for two
generations. Before retiring 18
years ago, Glaesser had worked at
the Post Office for 35 years, and as
a baker for eleven years, first under
his father and then as head baker
himself.
That's right. Even his Dad
worked here. "My dad's patent
leather shoes were 'eaten' right off
his feet by the ice and snow as he
walked up Magill Walk in the blizzard of '88." That would be 1888,

of us assume that our requisite time
at Swarthmore will be four years,
pretty cut and dried. We go to class,
eat, and sleep mostly in the confines

of this campus. Maybe we go to the
Ville for some rudimentary shopping. No big whoop. This place,
both the college and the surrounding
area, are merely a stop in our lives,
ultimately leading to bigger and bet-

things.
But for the faculty, administration, and especially the staff,
Swarthmore is much more. Not only
is it a place to work, but it is the
backdrop to their entire lives.
Swarthmore has been around for
over 100 years (131 for those actually counting) and scores of people
have been experiencing—living—this rich history. For these people,
Swarthmore is more than a stop. It's
home.
Recently, I was privy to such an
example of this "living history" in a
conversation I had with George
Glaesser. He's 82 and has spent 78

"Even when I was a kid we used
to go sledding down Wharton walk.
We'd sled right across the railroad
tracks before heading home."
An avid sports fan, Glaesser

athletics, even today. "One time, at
least five or so years back,
Swarthmore was up for the league

The Ville is as much a part of
Glaesser's life as the College. He
still lives in the house where he
grew up. How many of us will be
able to say that when we're 80?
Glaesser also was a member of
the fire company for 35 years. "The
town appreciates that the students
participate in the fire company. A
town has to have people ready to

fight fires."

While over the years contact
between students and Villeresidents
has diminished, there are more students active on the fire company
now than in the past. "Even a few
girls" are on the company, much to
Glaesser's approval.
Nevertheless, high property and
school taxes may keep such "town

treasures" as Mr. Glaesser from
continuing to live in Swarthmore.

"Swarthmore is

a

nice

town.

It's

kept up nice. We've never had trouble with students. But the taxes are
getting too high for seniors to stay.
It breaks our hearts to leave, but
some have to."

Pharmacy or the Co-Op, or even
watching the teenagers at Renato's,
remember that you might just be
passing through, but don't do anything too stupid. Your story could

Dave Matthews: Accomplished Musician, Cult Icon?
By Dominic Sagolla

The frenzy began way back last
January with Ben. He brought it
back from break and shared it with
his roommate, who played it for me
and the boys of Palmer. We dug it.
We dubbed it. We wanted more. But
we were the only ones who knew the
unclassifiable groove of the Dave

Matthews Band.
Now, the band's new release,
Under the Table and Dreaming,
spins in the stereos of Willets First
South, where you can hear a different track sounding from each room
at any given time. What IS it about
these five guys from Virginia that
sends carloads of Swatties up and
down the coast to hear them play?
The eclectic sound of the band is
only part of their attraction—there is
a special connection between Dave
Matthews Band and Swarthmore
College.
Matthews himself used to ride his
bike around Swarthmore's campus
as a boy, while his father visited a

CROSSWORD
j

friend in the physics department.
"Swarthmore has a special place in
my heart," Dave says, "I have a few
friends who graduated from there."
One of those friends is Sam
Erichson 'BB, with whom Dave
spent most of his off-stage time this
weekend. Backstage, Dave and Sam
recount silly tales of driving around
New York City, yelling, "WE'RE
FROM VIRGINIA!" at the top of
their lungs, hoping for the classic
NYC comeback, "Oh YEAH?!
F*#* YOU!" It was such revelry
that kept Dave and Sam from visiting campus this past Saturday, as
originally planned.
Certainly, the vanload of Swatties
forgave him after Dave shivered his
way outside the Tower Theatre to
say, "Hey y'all—l don't wantto you
be angry at Charlie. Sorry I didn't
make it out to campus, but I hope
you liked the show." Although it
was supposed to be a secret, Charlie
and I couldn't help hinting that Dave
would be attending Saturday's Bell
Tower Sing.

Charlie Mayer '9B, who helped
Dave up for an "All Things
Considered" interview on NPR earlier this year, made another
Swarthmore connection when he
handed Dave a tape of Sixteen
Feet's version of "Ants Marching."
"Hey, check it out," Matthews said
to his tour manager, "they're singing
our music at Swarthmore!" Since
then, the whole band has heard the
tape, due mostly to the enthusiasm

The Phoenix

Old Songs and Sanitary Mints Come to Mind
Well, I was sitting at dinner with
Becky, one of the infamous members of the stunning Roberts quipple
(It was a quad. We managed to drive
Vicki not only out of the quad but
out of the country. Now its a quipple.), and we were discussing the
misunderstood musical lyrics of our
youth. And believe you me, Becky
has some doosies.
My favorite, although only a
recently acquired delegate to her
digest of delusions, was her misrepresentation of Pearl Jam's new song,
"Better Man." When Eddie sings in
his own garbled way, "Can't find a
better man," Becky had believed
him to be singing, "Can't find a butter mint." Yes, a butter mint!
Probably one of the most disgusting
hard candies ever created by man or
beast and only eaten during periods
of great delirium or when confronted
by the little buggers in a decorative
plastic crystal bowl on the hostess'
podium while trying to escape from
the Mexican restaurant that has just
served
worst
the
you
enchilada/chalupa/taco combo platter anyone in the history of the world
has ever consumed.
And just as a little aside,

I was
watching Oprah the other day, and
the topic of the hour was basic
hygiene, the little things you can do
everyday to make your world a wee
bit cleaner. Oprah was dishing out
the normal dental hygienist propaganda about getting a new toothbrush once a month and flossing

daily when one of the panelists on
stage started spouting statistics
about a study he had seen concern-

ing those little bowls of unwrapped
mints that restaurants offer patrons
as they leave an eating establishment. Well, all I'm gonna tell you is
DON'T EAT THOSE MINTS.
WHATEVER YOU DO. DONT
EAT THOSE MINTS.
I don't care how much
they beg, how much

money they offer you,
or what sexual favors
they are willing to provide if you try one of
their candies, don't eat
those mints... okay,
you twisted my arm.
I'll tell you a little
more.
See if you can follow my logic. What
does

everybody

do

I
I
I
Lmhh

between the time that
they finish their meal
and the time that they stick their
hands in those bowls of mints as
they leave the restaurant? Now think
about the thing that everybody
should do but do not between the
time that they do this previous thing
and the time they stick their hands in
those bowls o- mints as they leave
the restaurant? Remember, this is a
show about common hygiene. They
did detailed chemical analyses on
these bowls of mints. If you've
caught on, you should be running to
the bathroom right now to drink 3

bottles of cool mint Listerine and
surgically remove your tongue.
So as Becky was relating to me
her misunderstood song lyrics, I
realized that I really couldn't think
of any cool lyrical stories myself.
Now this was a disturbing turn of
events, because I wanted to be able to
hold ud mv end of the conversation
with the oV Beckster.
As I racked my brain
for some kind of
humorous
musical
retort, the story of the
first album I ever
bought came to mind.
It must have
been around third
grade. Yeah, third
grade, since I was in
love
with Chris
Emerson because he
was the first boy in
our

class

to

braces. Not that I
loved
him
JUSt
because he had braces. He wore a
gold chain, too.
Anyway, I had just become aware
of the wonders of the 'Bos pop radio.
Previously, I had only listened to the
radio when I was in the car with my
mom. My radio listening entertainment was, therefore, limited to Polka
music and the Horticulture Hour.
However, my big sister Melinda had

But, if you're a woman, you know

we won't dance to anything by

that both heads are boring? (at this

Music Review: The Awesome

I was lucky enough to attend both
nights at the Tower Theatre, and it
gave me a new appreciation for the
diversity of this quintet from
Charlottesville, Virginia.
Dave Matthews himself considered Friday night's performance superior to Saturday's. This was probably due in part to the appearanceof
Blues Traveller's Harmonica Wonder, John Popper, who joined the
band for a blisteringly hot 'What
Would You Say.' The highlight of
Friday's show was the giant first jam,
including a three-song segue, capped
off by a reprise of the first. It was

Phishy on us in about half the years it
took Phish's songs to be recognizable enough to afford that kind of
segue. This is due in large part to the
free taping and trading that the band
encourages. No amount of set list
research could have prepared me for
what I heard the next day, however.
In response to the set list guessing
that goes on over Minarets (open
discussion of the band over the
InterNet), Dave said, "Well, we're
gonna throw 'em for a loop
toNIGHT." And how: the combination of 'Rhyme & Reason' ("A song
about too much of nothing"), the
much-requested cover 'All Along the
Watchtower,' and the frightening
encore 'Halloween' sent an evil vibe
that left the crowd wandering about
in a state of awe and confusion when
the lights went up.

Upper Darby simply was not prepared for the sound ofDave Matthews
Band when they are laying down a
nasty 'Warehouse,' or for the sweet
duet of Dave and Boyd doing John
Prine's 'Angel From Montgomery.'
Although the opening acts, Ugly
Americans and Big Head Todd & the
Monsters, did a good warm-up job,

the chill in the air after Dave's last
'Halloween' scream made the 20
degree Fahrenheit weather seem
balmy. For about2l Swarthmore students, the mood lightened considerably after Dave visited their packed
van outside the Theatre.
It Is comforting to know that, although the popularity of Dave
Matthews Band has grown exponentially in the last few years, they still
have time to sip some home brews
with their fans and talk about playing
under the tableand dreaming.

By George, Madness Abounds
By David Rich
Ifyou get some time this week and
feel like going to Philadelphia for a
movie at the Ritz, it may be better to
avoidThe Madness of King George.
That's not to say that there isn't
anything of value in the film (it isn't
Highlander 111 after all), but it is a
very difficult film to watch.
It is the story of King George the
Third and his struggle with
porphyria, an episodic, debilitating
diseasesimilar to schizophrenia, only
with the added bonus of turning the
urine a deep shade of blue. As we
quickly learn, George is very distraught by the loss of theNew World
colonies to the colonists, so distraught that no one is allowed to
raise the subject in the king's presence. However, we quickly see that
there is more: he talks to piglets,
takes wandering jaunts at sunrise
through the countryside (in his bedclothes), and he has taken a bit of a
romantic interest in one ofhis wife's
ladies-in-waiting.
,

As the story progresses, George's
madness deepens until he cannot
function and the Prince of Wales
maneuvers Parliament into naming
himRegent. The King's loy als, meanwhile, have him taken into the country to be rehabilitated by a country
doctor who has had some success
with curing madness.
As I said, the film is very difficult
to watch. At first, the nonsense bits of
George's madness are very funny,
almost human in a grandfatherly sort
of way. Quickly, though, we realize
that this is a man who is losing control of his faculties and descending
into the pit of his mind. The film
continues to show how horrifying it
must be to lose one's mind for almost
two hours. I felt that I had a handle on
it after the first hour, but...
The cast is phenomenal, however;
it's a virtual who's who of English
actors and actresses: Rupert Graves,
Nigel Hawthorne (as George), lan
Holm, Amanda Donohoe. They all

perform beautifully. Unfortunately,
most of their characters are throw-

aways. There's nothing special about
any of their characters, except for
Queen Charlotte. She's the only lovable character, and that's probably
only because she is the incredibly
idealized wife who will do anything
to protect and care for her husband.
However, therereally is a love that is
evident on screen between the King
and the Queen.

1 was really excited to see a period
piece, especially about the time of
the Revolution, but I must say I was
disappointed in Madness. Technically, the film is near flawless and
the actors are superb, but the story is
so bloody hard to sit through. I cannot, in good conscience give this
movie a rating higher than a (3)
Porky Pig.

The Women's Basketball team has had a
tough week. They faced top opponents in their
conference with opportunity to knock on the
door of a playoff spot. However, with tough
losses to Ursinus and Washington as well as
Johns Hopkins, this playoffposition is no longer
possible. The women now stand 9-13 with one
conference match remaining.
The week began with a trip to Johns Hopkins.
The women jumped outto a lead in the first half
and maintainedit most of thishalf. They trailed
28-29 at half. However, their shots just didnot
fall in the second half and Swat lost 67-46.
Nancy Rosenbaum '96 led Swarthmore in rebounds with 13. She also added 11points. Lisl
Cochran-Bond '97 led the Garnet in points with
12.
Swat next faced Ursinus at home. After a
struggling loss to Ursinus away, Swarthmore
was ready to prove themselves. Swat led at half
22-21. Once again though, the women were
unable to maintain this lead and fell to Ursinus
73-48. Cochran-Bond led Swat with 17 points
and Heather Maloney '95 added 12. Rosenbaum
added 11 rebounds for the team.
There was still a chance for these women to
make theplayoffs. They traveled to play Washington Sho'women on Wednesday. After a
tough first half where Swat played great defense and had trouble getting a shot to fall, they
were down 20-17. The secondhalfleft the team
unable to pull thelead and they fell to Washington 55-41. Emily Walker '96, with 11 points,

Swarthmore's wrestling team turned in another respectable performance this week. Last

suffered a loss at the hands of an extremely

convincing victory over a tough squad from
Johns Hopkins. The match against Hopkins,
which went down to the wire in overtime,
featured an incredibly exciting bout at the 167

Garnet will travel to Ursinus again, to participate in the NCAADivision IJJ Regional Qualifiers, to determine who will be competing in the
national tournament at Augustana College, in
Augustana, Illinois. Alec Stall '9B feels optimistic about the teams prospects at this point in
the season, saying, "Every wrestler on the team

affair with the ice and challenges hefaces as a

climber. Kylian continues his journey at the
beginning of a particularly difficult climb.
After ten feet, I have acquired a sensual taste
of this spirit frozen here. I no longer need to
look up to find axe placements, I know where
they belong. The axes vibrate on their own, and
I settle into rhythm. Axe, axe, foot, foot, axe,
axe, foot, foot, hang. Rest andbreathe. Pull up
and repeat. There is a state of concentration in
melody so intense that I feel nothing can touch
me on this weightless ice. At some point I look
down, fifty feet. I have forgotten to protect. I
bang in a snarg (ice piton), clip in, but since I
am unhappy with the disk of shattered ice
which surrounds it, I go for a good screw
placement also. My calves ache and sting by
the time I finish protecting, three minutes of
enforced motionlessness. Motionreturns, and
pain drains, drips down and washes away.
I am in a place where vertical ripples are
suggested by honeycombs dripping with water
and silent sculptures of a chest, inhaling deeply
inches from my nose. The motion of hips,
shifting weight from left to right and back, is
soothing, like the returning homeof a few days
before. The ice moves as if we walk, talk,
breath, and crawl for the samereasons. I enter
a relationship with this being who shares coexistence and life with me.
It is time to place again, as the ice deteriorates ten feet from the top, where sun exposure
has made it hollow, wet, and bitter. The first
screw goes in too easy, through three separate
layers of inch thick ice, separated each by an
inch of air. It'll never hold. I place another.
Water Sound Factorypours from the hollow
tube of this one, saturating my upper thigh,

dripping down my leg into the plastic boot, it
tempts me to shiver. The ice is only four inches
thick, and the water flowing behindit hasfound
release. I equalize the two, and clip the rope
through. Ice loves the intimacy of the climb as
I do, but does not wantto be left behind. This
is why the hardest move is from vertical to
horizontal, when your heels beg to be raised.
This would shear the crampons, and you would
become suddenly, inextricably, detached. I am
nervous, but soon stand flatly. Something about
this moment won't ever happen again.
Sean follows, falls a few times, but shortly
stands beside me. I lower him and rappel as the
sun sets, pack up. The walk out is long, quiet,
and dark. I feel as though lam leaving my love
behind.

will ascend several mountains, or at least one,

Swat Victory over Bears
Clinches Playoff Berth
By David Lischer
With one game remaining, the playoff
picture for the men's basketball team is almost as complicated as trying to anticipate
who'll make the NFL playoffs two weeks
early. In the simplest case, the Garnet (1310,9-3) can clinch the east division title and
home court advantage in the playoffs by
beating Muhlenberg Saturday. However,
Muhlenberg holds the tie-breaker over
Swarthmore. If they win on Saturday, the
Garnet will have to travel to Franklin and
Marshall for their first playoff game.
On Wednesday, Washington Collegekept
their playoff hopes alive in ending the
Swarthmore's six-game winning streak 8276. A victory would have clinched the title
and home court advantage for the Garnet.
The Garnet had soundly defeated Washington 78-71 earlier this season near the beginning of their just-snapped streak. In that
game, Sam Voolich '96 poured in a seasonhigh 20 points that game, and Kirk Daulerio
'95 set the conference record for rebounds in
a game with 21.
"Washington is a good team and probably
the most talented in the division," said Coach
Lee Wimberly. "I don't consider it an upset
in any way. These guys have done more than
anyone expected them to do." Not only has
Swarthmore guaranteed a winning season,
they have earned a division title in the Centennial Conference for the first time ever.
The Garnet wouldrather not face Franklin
andMarshallon theroad tostart theplayoffs.
F&M, ranked number one in Division 111
basketball, has clinched the West Division
title and needs only a victory over Washington to complete an undefeated season. If the
Garnet beat Muhlenberg, they will host
Western Maryland and get a chance at revenge. In November. Western Maryland
handed the Garnet one of only three conference losses.
The Garnet shutdown two ofWashington's
top scorers yet two others were able to pick
up the slack, and Ben Harris, the conference's

second leading scorer, poured in a game-high
27 points. With only two home losses this
season, Washington is very tough to play on
the road. But the next game will be more

difficult, as the Garnet strive to break
Muhlenberg's perfect home record.
Breaking out of a bit of a shooting slump,
Daulerio led the Garnet with 22 points and 15
rebounds. Ben Schall '97 added 13 and six
assists. Yet two of the strongest contributions
came from seniors Jim Foley and Chad Tanoff the bench.
While Foley and Tarr have had to setde for
diminished roles on this year's team, they
have made the most of their playing time of
late. Foley scored nine points and hit on three
of his four three-point attempts. Tarr scored
14points in only 15 minutes ofaction. He also
hit on three of his four three-point attempts
and grabbed five rebounds, three on the offensive boards.
The Garnet had narrowed the Washington
lead to four with about thirty seconds remaining, but the Shoremen were able to hit their
free throws in the clutch. The loss came on the
heels of two very close games against Johns
Hopkins and Ursinus, of the type that last
year's team probably wouldn't havebeen able
to pull out.
"I think this year we really come into the
games expecting to win. Even though we may
have a bad shooting game, our defense picks
us up. We're playing to win, instead of not to
lose," said Voolich.
Before the Washington game, the Garnet
were ranked first in team field goal percentage
defense, allowing opponents to sink only
40.3% of their shots. They were also second in
Scoring Defense allowing only 64.4 points
against in conference.
The Garnet have defeatedMuhlenberg once
already this season, 64-61. Since then the
Muhlenberg team has won four straight games.
"I think we're confident going into every
game that if we play well, we're going to win,"
said Schall.

game of the season? Although the victory over
Ursinus 55-54 was closer than it should have
been, itclinched at least a co-championship for
Swarthmore and a trip to the
Centennial Conference playoffs.
"It [scoring the I,oooth point]
was a big load off my mind. It
was weighing on my mind a lot.
I didn't know how close I was
until the Ursinus game," he said.
This is the Garnet's best season since 1990-91, the year before Daulerio came to
Swarthmore. The team's inability to put together a winning
season since thenstarted to wear
on Daulerio.
"Last year was the biggest

It's a good thing he did. Daulerio is second Voolich. "One thing that's funny is that he's
among conference players in rebounding (8.7 turning into an assist man. He's probably had
rebounds per game) and is the fourth leading more assists the second half of the year than

the conference record for most rebounds, 21, in
a game against Washington. He briefly held the
conference records for most points in a game
(34) and field goal percentage (.778) after his
"career night" against Western Maryland in
November.
Despite all his personal success, Daulerio
quickly passed the credit for the Garnet's successful season to his teammates.
"Last year none of these guys
were doing anything like what
they're doing this year. I'm doing the same thing. They're all
playing great," said Daulerio.
Daulerio is the team's only
returning double-figure scorer,

So enter Grant Hill. The product of an
idyllic suburban upbringing (his mother a lawyer and former roommate of Hillary Clinton's
at Wellesley, his father a Yale grad and NFL
star), Hill is the model of comportment on and
off the court, or at least the type of model the
NBA higher-ups want. He's a Duke graduate
after all (and that plays no small part in this).
His skills are nothing to sneeze at either. As a
rookie, he's playing the game at a level that
places him in the upper echelon of the league.
Is he an all-star though, and is he the kind of
player the league big-wigs are making him out
to be? The answer, to both of these questions,
is no.
By answering the above questions in the
negative, that'snot a put-down of Hill. I have
tremendous respect for his basketball ability
and in time I think he might be the best player
in the league. But he is not at that level quite
yet. If Grant Hill is an AU-Star, then Eddie
Jones, an equally (and in my mind more)
impressive rookie for the Los Angeles Lakers,
is an AU-Star as well. He's just as deserving.
But the way Hill is being promoted, one might
come to the conclusion that he was not only in
a different class from Jones, but that he was
Jordan reincarnate. He's not. He's Grant Hill
a high-scoring, oft-injured rookie on a cellardwelling team. Let's not forget that fact.
Stacking Up to the Competition: who is the
best player incollege basketball? It's a tough
question and it can be answered in two ways.
One can answer it by naming the best player at
-

the college level, or one can answer it by
judging which player possesses the skills that
promise to turn him into a great player at the
next level: I'll answer the former in my next
column. In this column, however, I'll say that
Jerry Stackhouse of the University of North
Carolina is the best player in the latter sense.
Stackhouse, a sophomore forward, is a phenomenal blend of athletic ability and basketball
smarts. I hate invoking the name of Jordan,but
Stackhouse's game begs the comparison. Not
since Jordan, in fact, has a player with such an
all-around game played for the Tar Heels.
Stackhouse, who fits best in the two or three
slot, has been forced to play a quasi-power
forward position for UNC this season. His 6'6"
height has not inhibited him in this position at
all, however, as he has shown a great deal of
strength and savvy in the paint. But it is when
Stackhouse can face the basket that he is at his
most dangerous (and reminiscent of Jordan).
His first-step is probably one of the quickest in
the college gameand I'd say thathis Lang-time
is unmatched. His assaults on the basket,
slicing through and soaring over defenses, are
something to watch. And remember, he's doing all of this playing for the conservative,
structured Dean Smith; the only man who was
ever able to hold Jordan to under twenty points
a game. If Stackhouse develops a more consistent outside shot, we might just witness something very special. And we might be witnessing that sooner rather than later, as there's
much speculation that he will forego his final
two years of eligibility and jump to the NBA
next season. He'd be a top three draft-pick for
sure.
