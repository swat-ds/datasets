Women's Activist Sarah Weddington Speaks
By Emily

of the landmark decision.

Shartin

On Tuesday night, in a talk entitled "Roe v. Wade: Past
and Future," attorney Sarah Weddington discussed her
integral role in the evolution of the debate on abortion
over the past three decades.
It was she who, late in 1971, wentto the SupremeCourt
to represent Jane Roe in the case against Dallas County
District Attorney, Henry Wade. Early in 1973,the ruling
was finally made: she was victorious, having secured the
right to abortion for women in the United States. Her
lecture on Tuesday coincided with the 24th anniversary

Ms.Weddington began the talk on a somber note,
admitting that lately she has been unsure of the future of
theRoe v. Wade decision. After winning her case 24 years
ago, she said she never imagined the issue would have
ballooned and intensified as much as it has. But she
clearly had faith in the younger generation's abilities to
deal with whatever happens next.
Ms. Weddington traced her days in high school, where
she was the President of the Future Homemakers of
America, to her decision to go to law school after being
told by her dean at McMurry College that she ought to

consider other plans because law school was too "strenuous" and no woman from McMurry had ever gone before.
The following summer Ms. Weddington became one of
five women in the entering class at the University of
Texas School ofLaw.
Remarkably, Roe v. Wade was Ms. Weddington's first
contested case. She gave a humorous account of the
grand, albeit nerve-wracking decorum of the Supreme
Court and her discovery that the only ladies' room to be
found there is tucked away in the basement.
But for Ms. Weddington, the issue is not always specifically abortion; rather itis "who gets to make the really
important decisions." She is not particularly worried
about abortion becoming completely illegal in the near
future. However, in light of the numerous episodes of
clinic violence over the past few years as well as recent
measures against public funding, she is worried about
how available abortion procedures will be in the coming
years. Her closing remarks included a hope thatthe ability
to answer important questions remains an individual right
and does not fall entirely into the hands of the government.

"Roe v. Wade: Past and Present" is the first in a Cooper
Foundation series of lectures entitled "Women's Victories." Organized last spring by Kristin Sostowski '97,

Amanda Rocque '97, Christine Poreba '97, and Herrin
Hopper '9B, the series brings a range of prominent female
civilactivists to Swarthmore. Both Hopper andSostowski
became particularly enthusiastic about bringing Ms.
Weddington here after reading her book A Question of
Choice (Penguin, 1993) a couple of years ago. All ofthe
organizers hope that she and the other speakers will be
key in facilitating campus discussion on a variety of
important issues.
Ms. Weddington spent much of Tuesday in the company ofSwarthmore students, including a reception at the
Women's Resource Center, followed by a dinnerbefore
thelecture. She also remained in the lobby of the Performing Arts Center long after the lecture, signing copies of
her book and talking with more students. Her candor and
sense ofhumor were unfailing, as was her encouragement
for all students working for the advancement of civil
issues. Says Sostowski, "Her enthusiasm for all our work
is incredible."
The "Women's Victories" series will continue through
February and March, Black History and Women's History Months, respectively. Scheduled to visit are Dr.
Mary Frances Berry, Professor of American Social
Thought at the University of Pennsylvania, and Dolores
Huerta, Secretary Treasurer of United Farm Workers.

Willets Scavenger Hunt Starts
By Wendy Kemp

Many students were involuntarily effected by the 9th
Annual Willets Scavenger Hunt, when, they were regaled
by e-mail from all four Willets floors, each proclaiming
their floor "superior" to the others. This activity, which is
one of the items in the Scavenger Hunt, was started on
January 19thby Willets third, followed by a quick rebuttal from the second floor, then the basement and finally
the ground floor. The activity spread to other parts of
campus, and students soon received an yet another e-mail
informing the campus that "there is only one center of the
Universe, and it is called Parrish 4W."
Ever since Thanksgiving, Willets residents have been
scrambling all over campus looking for items on the
scavenger list. The competition will continue foranother
three weeks. Each floor in the dorm represents one team;
the team with the most points will house the new television and VCR in its lounge. There is presently a television
in the basementof Willets; if the basement wins, they will
receive the new TV/VCR, and the old one will go to the
floor awarded second prize. "It's a lot of fun," said one
Willets resident, "but I don't think it's fair that the
basementwins either way. Even ifthey come in dead last,
they'll still have the old TV in their lounge."
Although the RAs were the ones to put the event
together, they are not allowed to help provide their hall
with any items on the list. However, they are still permitted "to motivate everyone on the hall," said Doug Rouse
'9B, the RA of Willets First North. Another rule forbids
members of one team from sabotaging another team's

chances at acquiring any ofthe items on the list. All of the
items can be obtained both free of charge and legally,
while all other methods of acquisition are "frowned

upon."

Even though one of the items on the scavenger list,
worth ten points, is an "all campus e-mail claiming hall
superiority," some Willets residents acknowledge that
the event spiraled out of control. In anothere-mail sent by
Willets Third, the floor which initiated the e-mail traffic
jam, an apology was offered.
"I would like to apologize," Na'im Tyson '9B wrote. "I
had no idea that every idiot on the campus would follow
my example." While the first team to send the message
had to type out every single e-mail address, the succeeding floors only had to copy the long address list and paste
it onto their own letter. This provided easy access to
anyone wishing to send an all-campus e-mail. Organizations such as HEP (Homework Enrichment Program) and
SOU (Swarthmore ueer Union) have both used the
recipient list recently to innundate the campus.
Although the e-mail portion of the scavenger hunt is
over, campus life is bound to stay interesting as the entire
list consists of over four pages of items. Some of the more
unusual items on the list include a point awarded for each
hall memberwho publicly admits to indulging in "hallcest"
and three points that will be given for a model of the Taj
Mahal made of toothpicks; three points will be awarded
to the team who convinces Santa Claus to visit Willets, 15
points for the McCabe globe, 10 points for a retired
couple from Florida, and 8 for an A+ orgo exam. A

Students find box lunches appetizing...

Box Lunch Sales Take Off
By Tony

Sturm

The box lunches offered by dining
services on Tuesdays and Thursdays
have become quite popular and have
aided in ameliorating the lunch rush
at Sharpies and Essie Mae's on those
days.
The box lunch (a misnomer, as
they come in white paper bags) was
initiatedlate last semester as a way to
provide students with a quick, premade lunch on Tuesdays and Thursdays, when the passing period between 11:20 a.m. and 1:15 p.m.
classes is only 40 minutes. Many
students have classes at both of those
times, and Sharpies and Tarble became overcrowded. Essie Mae's does
not accept students' lunch credit until
1:00 p.m., which forces students to
start getting in line up to 20 minutes
before the hour begins in order to get
their lunches.

program, has used the first two weeks
of this semester to determine exactly
how popular the program is. According to food services worker Cherie
Breischaft, last week, they sold 130
lunches on Tuesday, and 145 on
Thursday. This Tuesday, 168 were
sold, and from those figures, they
decided "Now itis going to be strictly
175 [lunches]."
The box lunches are available only
to students, most of whom find the
lunches very convenient. "I don'thave

Brandt '99.
Toby Patterson 'OO was tired of
being restricted to "cereal and sandwiches or where ever the line was
short," in Sharpies, and finds the box
lunch a nice option.
Director of Dining Services Linda
McDougall is happy with the program. "It has definitely alleviated the
lunch crunch," she said.
"It hasn't been an easy thing to do,"
said McDougall. "It has been logistically challenging."
The box lunches also cost a bit
more, due to additional equipment
and new food purchases as well as
paper goods, and the hiring of an
additional person was needed. But
"we've gotten a lot of positive response from students."
"They're a bit shabby," says John

Although Baugh was not suprised

to the "extreme nature" of the clause
which states that "African Language

Jumping Cow Closes
By

Jessica Roney

On January 20,1997 the Jumping Cow Ice Cream
and Coffee House, just outside the entrance to the
College, closed its doors for the last time.
Owners Terry Rumsey and Robin Lasersohn made
the decision last December to close the "Cow," as it
is affectionately called, in order to pursue their
former interests in social justice work.
Originally they planned to keep the Cow open and
begin work on their other commitments at the same
time, but eventually the strain of keeping the store,
doing their other work and raising a family at the
same time became too much. They decided that it
would be easier to close the store and find a buyer.
Currently they are talking to "several interested
buyers" and they hope that the establishment will be
up and running soon, continuing to provide Swarthmore students a pleasant atmosphere and the caffeine they enjoy.
Rumsey is now working to organize a group to
lobby to end the death penalty in Pennsylvania and
Lasersohn, Swarthmore class of 'B9, is doing parttime political work. Rumsey said that in the time that
they ran the Cow "we appreciated the life that the
students brought to the Cow, we learned a lot, and we
had a lot of fun."
The loss of the Jumping Cow leaves Swarthmore
with no nearby cafe on the nights which Paces is not
operating. Students without cars are now confined to
restaurants at the SpringfieldMall and Borders Bookstore on the Baltimore Pike, both of which are a ten
minute walk from campus.
Many students expressed disappointment in the

Muslim Students Celebrate Ramadan

Spring found under Lodge 6

By

Just before winter break, Lodge Six experienced a flooded basement, which is not uncommon for the Lodges. Upon returning from
break, the residents found their abode in a state of disarray. All
possessions stored in the basement were piled into the main room, and
the basement no longer had a floor. Sean Slotterbach '99 said, "My
first reaction was that of intense sadness at the loss of so much of
Tyler's [Stevenson '99] personal property. Many of his socks were
damaged and we estimate the total damage to the amount of $ 120." A
pumphas been placed in the basement to remove excess water, but the
lower level is still uninhabitable. Maintenance crews have also been
trekking through the Lodge sporadically since the end of break,
although the members of the Lodge "are not sure how much work is
to be done." Ryan Fruh '99 expressed concern: "They should fix this
problem before any of my computer games get damaged." Matt
Lillivis '9B shared a similar tone, "I am sick of water coming into our
Lodge and making our things damp." Stevenson jokingly added.

Course Offered on Sex
Much talk has circulated about the "course" entitled "Topics in
Human Sexuality," but students taking this "class" view it more as an
extension of ASAP or Safer Sex workshops. The five-session, nocredit offering is intended to "encourage people to open up and
become more comfortable discussing sexuality and sexual identity,"
says Brantley Bryant '99, who is enrolled for the first time in the
program. "Topics" covers a wide variety of issues such as sexuality
and identity in general, human sexual response, homosexuality/
bisexuality, dating and relationships. The workshop is led by two
therapists, and currently has approximately fifty participants. When
asked about the work involved with the class, Bryant said: "There is
no 'work-load' per se, it's more of a discussion group than a real
'course,' although it is intended to be informative, it's not approached
in an 'academic' way. The experiences you will gain deal with
yourself and how you communicate. Hopefully by the end you'll be
more comfortable communicating frankly and openly about sexuality." Anyone seeking more information should contact the program
coordinator, Andy Caffrey '99.

Daily Gazette competes with The Phoenix
Journalism at Swarthmore has found a new incarnation in the form
of the The Daily Gazette, a daily e-mail news service. The Gazette,
available through free subscription, now has 115 subscribers among
Swat students, faculty, alumni, and parents.
Sam Schulhofer-Wohl '9B conceived the The Gazette as a way to
inform the student body of important news and sporting event results
with a promptness that traditional paper news formats cannot equal.
The former publisher of The Phoenix sees his brainchild's timely
format as having "greater potential to carry interesting news stories
as opposed to investigativereporting, features, opinion pieces, etc.
than a weekly format." Schulhofer-Wohl also adds that "sports scores
are far more interesting ifthey are reported the morning after the game
takes place."
Editorial Board members of The Daily Gazette hope to increase
readership and staff size, and a Web page may also be a prospect in
the future. The Phoenix and The Gazette will also collaborate on
stories and both publications predict some overlap in articles.
In addition to Schulhofer-Wohl, The Gazette's editors are Fred
Bush '9B, Kate Doty 'OO, Jennifer Klein '9B, DavidLischer '97, Eric
Pakurar '97 and Sylvia Weedman '9B. Lischer and Pakurar, both
Phoenix veterans, oversee the sports side ofThe Gazette, while one of

Since January 10, Muslim students at Swarthmore have been observing Ramadan, a monthlong fasting period which is part of the Islamic
religious tradition.
The main purpose of Ramadan is to learn the
virtues of self-restraint, discipline and generosity.
Fasting occurs daily during the month, lasting
from daybreak to sunset. Observers are also required to avoid other sensual pleasures. During the
period, Muslims take part in additional prayers and
congregate for pre-dawn and sunset meals. Towards the end of Ramadan, Muslims celebrate Eid
ul-Fihtr, with collective prayer for three days.
Additionally, Muslim communities usually donate to charities at this time.
According to Ethan Devine 'OO, co-president of
the Muslim Students Association, a substantial
number of Muslim students are practicing the
traditonal rituals of Ramadan. For most students,
fasting starts at around 5 a.m. and ends at 5:30 p.m.
Dining Services has made a special arrangement
for boxed breakfasts, and a group of students
usually gather to break fast after sunset in Sharpies. On top of the usual five prayers a day—two of
which occur before the daybreak and sunset

bungee jumping.
Haverford and Bryn Mawr had better watch out too, since 15
points will be awarded for one of the Haverford Goats, and a
whopping 26 points to any Willets team with a statue from Bryn
Mawr that measures over three feet.
In the meantime, individuals continue to use the 1364 address

Japanese classes are now being

Pacific Rim Organization members
are teaching half-credit pass/fail
courses in introductory and intermediate Japanese.
Tsuyoshi Mitarai '9B founded the
PRO in the fall of 1995 and began
teaching introductory Japanese in the
spring of 1996, even before the PRO
was officially chartered. There was
only one section offered that first
spring, and as Mitarai says with a
smile, "the class was not as organized
as last semester." Last fall, other instructors—among them Ryusuke
Ishikawa '97, Takuji Aida '9B and
Miho Tsuji '9B and coordinator Paul
Hsu '9B—joined Mitarai and, last
semester two introductory, one intermediate, and one advanced class were
offered, all in the evenings.
The dynamics of the program attracted a very diverse group of students. There were two engineering
professors, a student from Strath

Haven High School, an older adult,
his granddaughter, and several
Swarthmore students. Previously,

interested students had to travel to
Haverford and try to squeeze five
days of Japanese instruction into their
schedules.
Despite the growth in the Japanese
classes, there was a problem with the
program. As the semester wore on
many students had to drop out of the
Japanese courses because they could
not afford to commit three hours per
week to a non-credit class. Aware of
this problem, and feeling that their
studentsdeserved credit, the instructors were determined to secure credit
status for the courses.
Stephanie Wang '99, president of
the PRO, and Jessica Harbour *99,
PRO language coordinator, discussed
the course with Mitarai and the other
Japanese instructors, and gained the
support of Professors Maribeth

Millertold The Gazette. "I was not aware it would upset so many
people. I also didn'tknow that such all-campus e-mails were a
violation of school policy. If I had known that, I wouldn't have
sent the e-mail."
Octavio Gonzalez '97, who sent the SQU message, said his
intention was to reach people who aren't already SQU members.
"I didn't want to justpreach to the converted," he said. Only five
people complained to him about his message, he said.
Victoria Petitt '99, who sent the HEP message, stated that she
sent the e-mail because she thought HEP would "be something
everyone might be genuinely interested in." According to Petitt,
certain people overreacted and sent her e-mails, one of which
called her the "lowest scum of the earth" for filling "our boxes
with such trash."

Elizabeth R. OuYang, staff attorney at the Asian American Legal
Defense and Education Fund in New York City, gave a lecture
entitled "Causes of Asian American Violence" on Thursday at 4:15
p.m. in the Intercultural Center. The lecture was sponsored by SAO,
Forum for Free Speech, Program in Public Policy, Department of
Political Science, and Career Planning and Placement Office.
OuYang began by describing issues in which the Asian American
Legal Defense Fund is involved. They are working to ensure voting
rights, prevent restrictions on immigration, and obtain redress for
Japanese Americans interned during WorldWar 11. Lately, they have
also been working on issues ofAffirrmative Action and environmental racism.
OuYang then enumerated recent acts of violence against Asian
Americans. One included the brutal murder of Vincent Chin in 1982
by two autoworkers who, mistaking Chin for a Japanese, attacked him
because they thought the Japanese were responsible for the fall of the
American auto industry. Inviting the audience to participate, she
discussed some commonalities in these incidents. Some resulted
from American anxieties about Asian economic power, while others
were motivated by resentment about American wars abroad, particu-

Baugh Involved in Ebonics Controversy
(Continued from page I)

The Oakland School Board has repeatedly
claimed that they meant "genetically based" to
mean "the origins of the language;" however,
Baugh says that their words were "poorly chosen."
The phrase "genetically based" was eliminated
from the revised resolution of January 15th, and
the Oakland School Board also softened their
stand on African-Americans speaking a language
separate from English. Because of the hostility
generated by their obvious desire to use Title VII
funds to support their program, TheBoard has also
claimed that they never intended to use bilingual
education funds.
States such as South Carolina and Virginia have
drafted bills to ban the teaching of Ebonics in

remarked Devine. "It's a chance to...really bask in
the connectedness and spiritual centeredness of
the occasion," Devine added.
Sympathy is another major theme of the tradition. "You learn to live without the things...you
most quickly take for granted, and it really gives
you a lot of perspective, which naturally leads to
compassion," said Abbas Ebrahim 'OO, another
Muslim student. Asked how it felt to celebrate
Ramadan at school, Devine said, "You're encouraged to pray in a large group, which is difficult
since there are no mosques nearby, but your relationship with God is something you can carry with
you." According to Ebraham, "everyone is very
accepting." "My friends have been extremely
supportive...they make sure that I eat enough,"
commented Shirin Ali 'OO, who is currently fasting.
Devinealso acknowledged the help provided by
various departments in facilitating with the celebrations. "LindaMcDougal hasbeen fantastic, .in
providing the box breakfasts, and the people in

even though there's no Muslim religious
adviser
have really bent over backwards in
allowing us to host all-night services and to help us

meals—Muslim students are also participating in
extended and all-night prayers. Extended prayers
occur at any timebetween the last prayer of the day
and daybreak; they usually consist of 8-20 extra
cycles of prayer, during which approximately
l/30th of the Qur'an is recited. All-night prayers
are usually performed in a mosque (or masjid), and
can happen anywhere from once to seven times
during Ramadan. For Eid, Devine himself plans on
traveling to a mosque in New York; he notes that
other students have similar plans.
This Saturday, members of the Muslim Students
Association will be breaking fast along with Muslim students from Haverford and Bryn Mawr students.
The organization will be setting up desks next
week in Parrish Parlors towards theend ofRamadan
where detailed information on the holy month and
the Muslim religion will be available. A possible
interfaith Iftar (a fast breaking meal) celebration is
also in the works.Furthermore, a donation of $9OO
worth of food supplies will be given to the local
community.
Ramadan is an occasion for self-reflection and
contemplation. "For me, it's a time of elevated
awareness, both spiritually and personally...it's a
time to step back and observe myself...it's not a

Citing other incidents of discrimination, including Senator
D'Amato's mocking of Judge Lance Ito during the O.J. Simpson trial,
OuYang emphasized that even Asians who have been in the United
States for many years and speak perfect English are still regarded as
foreigners.
OuYang cited the influence of media in promoting stereotypes of
Asian Americans, and described still existing legally sanctioned
discrimination. For example, some states are trying to eliminate the
Fifth Preference immigration category which allows Asian Americans to bring their relatives to the United States.
According to OuYang, today, there are many subtle ways in which
discrimination against Asian Americans is manifested. For example,
a New Jersey statute requires signs in English, even though the
neighborhood in question consisted of mainly Chinese businesses
and restaurants.
At the end, OuYang proposed some ways to fight back. The vote
is very important because "people don't listen to you if you don't
vote." Also, it is important to take a "more participatory role." She
ended by describing recent gains by Asian Americans, including the
election this year in Washington state of the first Asian American
governor on the mainland of the United States.

public schools, and currently the Senate is debating whether federal funding can be given to Ebonics
programs. In spite of the ongoing debate about
federal funding for such programs, in Oakland,
teachers continue to use Ebonics to increase their
students' successful acquisition of standard English.
Baugh hopes that, although the controversy has
"clearly, thus far, been linguistically divisive," the
focus will shift from questioning the legitimacy or
the illegitimacy of the term "Ebonics" and educators will refocus their attention on the plight of

African American students."
Baugh also hopes that this controversy will raise
awareness of the educational needs of other low
income minority students who speak a different
dialect of English.

Dining Services Increases
Box lunches to Meet Demand
(Continued from page 1)
lunches. "But it's so much quicker, it's
worth it." The lunches always have a vegetarian option and usually a meat option. For
example, yesterday one could have either a
turkey sandwich orpasta salad and a bagel as
a main course, while on Tuesday the option
was peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, of
which there were two in every bag.
The popularity of the box lunches poses a
completely new problem for Tarble; "Now
we need places to eat," noted Dan Green '99.
The dining area in Tarble was often full
before the box lunch option, and now, withit
too cold outside for students to eat on Parrish
Beach or in the Fragrance Garden, many

students can be observed wandering aimlessly with their box lunches in their hands,
looking for a place to consume them before
class.
Still, the option is very popular. The line
outside Essie Mae's has shrunken to 20-30
students, and the fast moving line for box
lunches often extends out the door ofTarble.
"It is better than Tarble," said Julie Suh
'97. "I don't have to wait until one [o'clock],
and they're decent lunches."
Students have also complained about the
options, citing that they do not like the random way in which drinks are distributed or
the wide use of plastic and paper wrappers.
But McDougal is happy with the system. "It's
going to remain the way it is," she said.

Ebonics Debate Reflects Deeper Issues
By

Vincent Jones

Recently the Oakland School District voted to declare Black English,
or "Ebonics," an official language. In
doing so, Oakland ignited a national
debate over the legitimacy ofEbonics
as a language distinct from
standard
English.
Despite objections of
several linguists, parents, students, politicians, and

Next time, just give us the chocolates

others of
varying racial/ethnic
backgrounds, other school districts
vocalized their interest in the idea. In
fact, a prominent member of the Los
Angeles School Board recently put
forth a proposal ofher own to expand
existing programs utilizing Ebonics
to teach Black students standard English more effectively.
Given the lackluster performance
of the Oakland school district, it
should be commended for attempting to provide a higher quality education for its students. Yet, the district

Chocolates and Choosing is supposed to be a fun time: the entire class

gathers to enjoy a night of yummy snacks and professors joking around.
However, the choosing part is the most important: picking a major is serious
business. And for many, it also appears to be rather discouraging business.
Ask a dozen faculty or administration figures for their opinion of what you
should major in, you'll get a dozen answers. We've heard horror stories—faculty advisors who won't sign proposed major forms until their advisees
decide to go honors, administrators who tell students that they're "boring"
unless they're doing something besides a straight major. At Chocolates and
Choosing, we hear the faculty and administration's point of view: they prefer
a plain vanilla major. No concentrations, no double majors.
As Chocolates and Choosing continued, a student noted the absence of a
representative from the Biology Department. Bob Gross laughed and attributed it to the desire to discourage additional majors in what is always one of
the most popular and crowded departments.
Well, that's a shame, because it's also where some of us have received some
of the most personal attention and fulfillment in classes at Swarthmore. The
research opportunities are great and the students are committed. Shouldn't the
administration delight in the success of the department and the enthusiasm of
its students?
We feel thatstudents shouldbe encouraged to spend theiryears at Swarthmore
as they see fit. Anyone who has the proper qualifications should be welcomed
into a department as a major and given the resources they deserve. While
advising is certainly important, advisers should not be allowed to coerce
students. Furthermore, as long as someone has the grades to get into a
program, they should be allowed to, and should neither be pressured to go
honors or to avoid honors.
When a program, like biology, is exceedingly popular, the College needs
to recognize that fact and expand funding, not discourage majors. College is
a time of intellectual exploration. Let's not have the motivation to explore

Stop the email madness
We all know Willets is a little crazy. And we accept that. We can even
overlook their craziness most of the time. That's why it seems so surprising
that the campus has not ignored, but instead followed in the footsteps of
Willets' latest nuttiness: all-campus e-mails.
Now Willets had a purpose, insignificant as it may seem to the approximately 1,400 students whose e-mailboxes were cluttered with an e-mail
authored by a member ofeach floor in Willets claiming their superiority over
all the other halls. Willets had a scavenger hunt. The e-mails were annoying,
stupid perhaps, and most of us assumed that the incident would pass.
But instead, oddly enough,people somehow latched onto the ideathat using
the e-mail addresses of every single student on campus for the purposes of
propaganda was a really good idea. We are not suggesting that these more
recent e-mails have not had a worthy message, just that these e-mails are not
quite the proper means ofreaching out to the whole student body. There is, in
fact, a reason why until a Willets resident decided to manufacture a list of the
e-mail addresses of every single student: the ready-to-mail list of e-mail
addresses were reserved. See, no one wanted us to get the inane e-mails we' ve
been getting lately. No one wanted students to be able to use this method of
communication to advertise anything they felt driven to display to the entire
student body. And yet it's happened.
Several years ago, when the age of e-mail technology had just hit the
campus, the list of student e-mail addresses was not reserved. Ask any senior
on campus how they felt about receiving up to twenty e-mails a day about
subjects as ludicrous as a claimed lost pair of underwear (which then
prompted a response from the supposed owner of the lost underwear insisting
that the entire incident was false). Ask justhow many ofthese messages it took
until the list of student e-mail addresses became reserved.
Let's face it: these emails are annoying. There must be more efficient ways
of communicating your message to the student body. Certainly tabling at
Parrish and Sharpiesand Tarble is a pain, but at least it provides a filter so that
only those students truly interested stop and listen or pick up information.
In these next few weeks as the Scavenger Hunt nears its end, Willets'
residents are going to be doing things as inane as collecting 150 Snapple lids
and trying to "borrow" statues from Bryn Mawr and Haverford. Are we all
going to follow this example? A little restraint, arising from the use of
common sense, surely must be exercised.

We goofed. Already.

dampened.
If the reason behind discouragement is a lack of available funding, perhaps
the administration should realize where much of its funding comes from.
Students and their families don't work hard and pay enormous amounts of
money only for students to be discouraged from majoring in what they truly
want to major in.
But this is not simply an issue of the fact that students pay money to attend
Swarthmore. As a liberal arts institution that encourages enrichment and
academic exploration, the administration needs to live up to what we, as
students, came here for. The solution is more professors instead of shiny
copper water fountains, expanded course offerings to reduce lotteries instead
of clowns to entertain us at registration, a list that can go on and on.
Nearly every year, the largest percentage of first-years enter Swarthmore
with"Undecided" written in the blank on their paperwork for intended major.
The filling in of that blank is a decision that requires advising and careful
thought, not discouragement or jokes that fall flat.

could probably address its problems
better by retooling its schools to prepare students for the 21st century
rather than furthering tensions and
vying for greater access into the large
pool of money set aside for bilingual
education. Moreover, Oakland's efforts would benefit greatly if the nation set educational improvement as
a national priority.
Although most major media outlets highlighted the school board's
decision to declare Ebonics a second
language, the public very seldom
hears one of the underlying reasons
behind the move. I have yet to hear or
read any stories discussing the lack
of money available to the Oakland
school district, especially when compared to its suburban counterparts.
Neitherhave I heard or read any journalistreporting on the challenges such
underfunding presents for a school
district struggling to educate its students.
In my opinion, a constrained budget, rising costs, and a large pool of
federal funds available for bilingual
education mainly spurred Oakland's
decision. It seems as ifOakland school
officials hoped to tap into thatpool of
monev to fund a variety ofinitiatives
geared to provide its Black students

an education that will allow them to

Issues of race, ethnicity and sexuality have become particularly important on college campuses as they
are opened up to increasingly diverse
populations. In making colleges comfortable places for queer people,
women, and people ofcolor who face
both the intense pressure involved in
college life and issues of diseriminatiop.the means for combatting racism, sexism and homophobia have
become controversial and increasingly important.
Student groups such as SAO, SQU,
HOLA, and SASS have been created
to provide emotional and other support for students who are at a disadvantage due to discrimination and
social inequalities. These organizations have come under fire from Student Council in recent years because
of their limited membership. (The
membership of each group is closed
to all except Asian, Queer, Latino,
and Black studentsrespectively.) Student Council money provides the
funding which enables these groups
to exist and be active both in their
constituents' lives and in the campus
community. Withdrawing the
College's financial support would
endanger their survival. In light of
the current atmosphere of backlash
against the affirmative action ideology which is set up in promote an
environment of equal opportunity,
we feel it is important to reiterate the
necessity of these support groups.
Support groups and the buildings
in which they are housed provide a
desperately needed safe space for
groups of students who are disproportionately victims of physical and
verbal violence. If these groups admitted members from outside their
constituent groups, who do not face
the same experiences and issues, then
that safe space would cease to exist.
Time set aside for monoracial and
all-queer discussion allows members
of these groups to discuss thoughts,
ideas, emotions, and experiences related to extremely sensitive issues
within a group that shares a facet of
common identity. This forum for discussion is not accessible through any
other institutionalized means. Organizations such as the Race/Ethnicity
Study Groups, while providing a vital function, cannot provide the same
space for exploration and discussion
and cannot allow the same freedom
in speaking out as do the support
groups.
Furthermore, support groups allow
for a confidentiality which is absolutely necessary for members of
groups for which personal safety and
equality are at risk. This is especially
true with SQU. If the Queer Union's
meetings were open to the campus at
large, closeted gays (who may fear
for theirhealth and well being) would
either be prevented from joining or
would face involuntary "outing".
Similarly, membersof support groups
who may wish to express unpopular
or experimental ideas about race.or

sexuality might feel uncomfortable
expressing those opinions to a mixed
audience, even though those opinions might be valid and necessary.
The spaces in which support groups
are housed, currently the IC and the
BCC, are open to the entire College
population, except fortheiroccasional
use for closed meetings. The resources
these spaces provide in terms of libraries, research, entertainment, and
social events are invaluable. Support
groups make concerted efforts to outreach to the College community
through the creation of these important resources. These groups share a
unique set of perspectives and experiences withthe College through outreach activities enriching the College
community and the educational experience at this College. They also
contribute by promoting diversity and
community on a small campus, and
by providing support for otherwise
marginalized groups.
Support groups are an organized
response to institutional racism and
prejudice often perpetuated by other
members of the community,. Support
groups are an attempt to begin to
compensate for the prejudice people
of color, women, and queer people
face by partially equalizing the levels
of support received by each member
of this community. Institutional commitment to the provision of this support shows that we as a college recognize the harm that institutional discrimination causes.
Funding of student support groups
with student resources is entirely legal at a private institution. Although
this is often doubted by detractors,
who also denounce support groups as
a form of "reverse discrimination," in
fact, support groups allow this College to aim at its goal of being an
equal opportunity institution.
Support groups provide opportunities for leadership not otherwise available and produce leaders who enrich
the College community and the College profile. To dissolve institutional
funding of these groups would deny
the appreciation and the debtthis college community owes to the leadership and leaders which have come
from within support groups. In addition, to dissolve these groups would
distinctly lessen the attractiveness of
theCollege to a diverse pool ofpotential applicants, further adding to the
difficulties the College already faces
in recruiting applicants who are representative of the ethnic and sexual
diversity of this country and the global community.
In short, the rest of the College
community would have nothing to
gain and everything to lose were institutional funding for support groups
to be dissolved. Perhaps people who
are not a part of these groups would
better understand their value if they
wouldavail themselves more often of
the important resources these groups
provide to the College community.
While this opinion refers specifically
to the four groups already mentioned,
the rationale extends to other groups
on campus as well..

Letter to the Editor
Debate Over Parking Expansion Continues With
Engineer's Response to Economics Argument
To the Editor:
Professor John Caskey's letter on
the parking problem at Swarthmore
which was published last weekraises
the issue of potential costs to the
community of a new parking garage
on campus. In his letter, Professor
Caskey indirectly refers to the Senior Engineering Design Project
(E9O) currently under way to design
such a garage under the rugby field
and provides some criticisms of the
project for what appear to him to be
reasonably valid concerns. Yet Professor Caskey has missed several
key aspects of the project as have
several other members of the College community. It appears that I am
obliged to clarify some of the points
David Mimno made in his article
published in the November 22,1996
Phoenix for the benefit of the College community as a whole.
First and foremost, the project is
intended as a learning tool. While
the project team will do all the calculations and prepare all the drawings
necessary to build the garage, I sincerely doubt that it will ever be constructed. The project is in no way
connected with nor endorsed by
Swarthmore's administration.Do not
expect to see the only patches of
green grass remaining on north campus crawling with bulldozers any
time soon. The project is conceived
as a new way of thinking about the
traditionalsenior engineering design.
Instead of doing individual projects,
four of us are working together in a
cooperative effort on single, massive project which will integrate our
engineering curriculum into a cohesive whole, simulating a "real-world"
design experience.
In preparing our design, we considered many alternative sites for
our garage, including the current
DuPont parking lot, Cunningham
Field, and the Crum Woods just behind Cornell Library. For a variety
ofreasons, including accessibility to
north campus, general safety, and
the appearanceof this beautiful campus, we concluded the rugby field
location was well suited to a underground garage. While a number of
Whittier Placeand Elm Avenue residents have expressed concern about

the hypothetical garage site (ignoring thefact that it will probably never
be built), the site was chosen very
carefully, and in our final presentation, an alternative means of accessing the garage will be proposed. We
plan to go to great lengths to minimize the total impact of the design to
both the college campus and the borough of Swarthmore.
Finally, I take issue with Professor
Caskey's reasoning that the College
administration should not subsidize
the construction of its facilities for
the community they serve. He does
accurately state that the cost per parking space wouldbe about $B,OOO, but
in an informal survey we conducted,
each person with whom we spoke
said that he or she would be willing to
pay a nominal fee for the privilege of
parking on campus. A cost estimate
for a new garage prepared for the
College in 1989byLehrerMcGovern
Bovis, the general contractor for
Kohlberg Hall, estimated that a 200300 car garagewould cost $6,123 per
space.
With tongue in cheek, one might
point out that Kohlberg Hall cost
approximately $3OO per square foot
to build. While I have never been in
Professor Caskey's nice, new office,
I would estimate that it is approximately 10 feet by 8 feet, yielding a
cost of $24,000 for his office alone.
Is it appropriate for the College (and
its students) pay such an amount for
his office?
By his own logic, Professor Caskey
would have to argue that, no, the
College should not subsidize facilities which only one person uses. On
the other hand, I firmly believe that
the College has an obligation to provide the facilities which allow the
community to function efficiently. I
don't mind subsidizing Professor
Caskey's office in the economics
department with my tuition dollars
despite the fact that I haven't taken
an economics course since my freshman year. A new parking garage on
this campus is not essential, but it
would relieve many of its parking
problems, even at $B,OOO per parking
space.

Opinions
One More Thing or One More Slander? Letters to the Editor
By

Sean

Barney & Alyssa
Rayman-Read

For some time now, a familiar face
has weekly graced the third page of
our student newspaper. Vincent Jones
has established himself as an outspoken campus critic on issues such as
politics and race relations as they
manifest themselves both here at
Swarthmore and across the country.
He has become involved during his
first three years at Swarthmore in a
dizzying array of student activities
and consequently, emerged as one of
the most informed observers of campus life. As a weekly columnist, Jones
clearly has the world to offer to those
whoread his musings. Nonetheless, a
recent column by Jones entitled "National Trend Threatens Support
Groups"raised questions of whether
providing his readers with accurate
information is really at the top ofhis
admittedly long priority list.
Vincent Jones's columns are most
appropriately compared withthe editorial page of the Wall Street Journal,
with all the same virtues and faults.
The primary feature of Jones's column and the Journal's editorial page
is that they are both unabashed and
wholly predictable in their partisan
stance. Their great common virtue is
that they contribute to the "uninhibited, robust, and wide-open" debate
on public issues. Their great common flaw is that they rarely let the
facts impede their ambitious heads of
steam. Both assail their enemies with
innuendoand accusation, laundering
charges against their enemies
uncritically, and exploiting theirreaders' trust in them as informed and
informative sources.
In the first Phoenix issue of this
new year, Jones used the occasion of
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day to
attack a Student Council proposal
that group leaders and Council leaders come together to discuss concerns about the status of our campus
support groups under federal law.
Realizing, I would imagine, that advocating a blind ignorance of law
was not advantageous ground from
which to obliterate his opponents,
Jones decided to reconstruct the debate in terms more conducive to rhetorical destruction.
Instead ofrecognizing that Student

Council has not questioned the value
of support groups to this community
or discouraged their full flourishing,
he found it much more convenient to
hurl righteous indignation against
members of the "so-called student
government" whose diabolical goal,
he told his readers, is to "succeed in
delegitimizing support groups." Instead of analyzing for his readers
(presumably the goal of the columnist) the suggestion ofStudent Council that the community get the facts
about the legal stipulations that come
with the federal money that many
students rely on to attend this place,
or perhaps enlightening his readers
himself on these facts, he found it
much more provocative to discuss
the facts with regard to the legality of
Proposition 209 in California.In sum,
instead of explaining why the community should not come together to
share informationand to work through
complexity, including balancing legal constrictions on federal financial
aid and the Student Activites Fund
with community interest in support
groups, by way of a consensus decision-making process, Jones found it
more conducive to stigmatize Council members and to exacerbate a growing division of student opinion.
This policy of stigmatize and divide is a hallmark of the Wall Street
Journal editorial page. In 1994,when
President Clinton nominated Lani
Guinier to head the civil rights division of the Justice Department, the
Wall Street Journal, like Jones, decided that the real arguments advanced by theirvillain ofchoice were
not quite scurrilous enough for their
prosecutorial taste. In a scathing editorial, the Journal attacked Guinier
as a "quota queen," evoking theracist
and classist imagery of Ronald
Reagan's assault on "welfare queens."
Not only did the Journal blatantly
misrepresent Guinier's legal arguments, they assaulted her personal
dignity and encouraged theirreaders
to spite her as one who supposedly
would spite them.
Unfortunately, the article also
served the Journal's political purpose; Guinier was hissed like a witch
from the national political stage—a
victory for partisanship, a setback for
the integrity of professional journalism. Jones is clearly winning a simi-

lar, and similarly dubious, partisan
victory. He has served to vindicate a
particular Council member who
warned the Council last semester that
there would be "hell to pay" if Council was naive enough to believe that
on this campus, on this issue, informed and constructive communitywide discussion could be promoted.
Being uninformed itself, Student
Council submitted a Hewlett Grant
application in November proposing a
retreat where Council members, student-group leaders, and Dean's staff
members would discuss issues surthe legal status of
rounding
Swarthmore's campus support
groups. Since then, members of
Council have had their views distorted beyond recognition and have
become fodder for what is becoming
a campus sport of naming names on
an unwritten black list of assumedto-be campus bigots.
Jones provided a pointed culmination to all of this when he insinuated
in the Phoenix that "certain Student
Council members" were "cronies" of
"those who unabashedly herald the
degree to which they have dismantled
decades of progress," and that they
sympathize with "the concerted efforts of the public and private sector
to marginalize people of African descent throughout American history,
keep women barefoot and pregnant,
and deport Asian and Latino immigrants ..." Given our strong sense of
community values at Swarthmore,
these intimations were clear means,
ifnot to stigmatize their targets, at the
very least to mortify them utterly
before their peers.
Besides a responsibility to their
readers who may (or may not) be
expecting fair and reasonably professional reporting, commentators such
as Jones and the Journal also have
some responsibility to those they castigate. The pain that can be inflicted
through the slanderous written word
is considerable.
It must be remembered that public
figures are people, and that if the
press is to retain the invaluable right
to subject them to uncompromising
critique for their handling of the public trust, it must exercise that right
with responsibility and discretion.
There is no question that public figures should be accountable for their

actions and statements. However,
when journalists no longer feel compelled to represent these actions and
statements responsibly in the course
of critiquing them, but rather take
license to slander those they disagree with by willfully recasting them
to caricature the predilections offascists and tyrants, then it must be said
that it is the journalists who abuse
the public trust. Should such journalists be prosecuted for libel? No, not
in a free country. Should their own
sense of journalistic ethics, on the
other hand, compel them to selfregulating caution? Yes, indeed; and
for the very sake of a free country.
The reason that such caution must
be exercised at the national level is
the awesome scope of circulation
that unfair innuendo and accusation
can receive, with the potential existing literally to ruin a person by slander. The reason for caution here is
the inverse. This is a tremendously
small community. "Public figures"
on campus are students like everyone else, who eat at the dining halls
and live in the dorms. One should be
careful about making accusations that
would suggest a person's unfitness,
perhaps to even live in this community, let alone to play a leadership
role in it. The accusations that Jones
hasmadeabout certain StudentCouncil members borders on suggesting
such unfitness.
No one on Student Council can
successfully escape the fishbowl of
their immediate environment to address enthusiastic audiences around
the country as Lani Guinierhas done.
The point of this piece is not to suggest that people should feel sorry for
Student Council members, or even
that Council members shouldn't be
"getting it" from the likes ofVincent
Jones; the fact is that people who
accept responsibility should have
thick enough skin to accept criticism—and even slander, sometimes.
The point is merely to pose the question of what kind of discourse we
want to promote in this supposedly
collegial community. Split off into
divided and hostile camps, we rarely
do more than hurl barbs at each other.
We have a disturbing tendency to
personalize every disagreement and
to speculate freely about imputed
motives rather than to engage criti-

Parking is a Necessity for Some Employees
To the Editor:
I would like to respond to John P.
Caskey's letter this past Friday regarding the parking shortage on campus. I am a staff member who drives
what Professor Caskey refers to as a
"polluting private car" I do not drive
to work for the sheer luxury and enjoyment of driving, but rather out of
necessity.
For many members of the college
community, public transportation is
not an option. In my case, for instance, a trip to Swarthmore via public transportation would involve numerous transfers, and hours, not minutes, added to my daily commute.
This, for myself, would be a twelve
month commitment. I would also
like to add that drivers do, indeed,
incur transportation expenses; those

Affirmative Action

related to the ownership, operation
and maintenance of their vehicles.
An additional fee, of what may
amount to a 5% decrease of income,
is absurd.
I feel the suggestion of burdening
those who drive to campus with the
cost of a new parking facility is myopic. The bottom line is a parking
shortage does exist on campus, and
has for some time. Itremains an issue
of space, or lack thereof. The reality
is many students, staff, and faculty as
well as visitors on campus, need space
to park.
The solution to this problem lies in
finding the most equitable and environmentally sound means to satisfy

is Part ofRacist System

To the Editor:
Last weekVincent Jonescited "the
system" in this country as "inherently racist." I looked up racism in
my Mirriam-Webster's Collegiate
Dictionary andfound two definitions:
"1. a belief that race is the primary
determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences
produce an inherent superiority of a
particular race; 2. racial prejudice or
discrimination."
Since a "system" cannot have beliefs, I assume Jones meant that "the
system" in the country is inherently
racially prejudiced and discriminatory. By this, I am sure he means that
thereexist government laws and policies that involve such racism.

Jones advocates affirmativeaction,
which he describes as a measure
"aimed at improving the condition of
colored and other Americans..." It
also gives government, part of "the
system," I assume, "ability to provide women and people ofcolor equal
access to thebenefits [ofcitizenship]."
Hence, by Jones' description ofaffirmative action, it qualifies as a racist
measure, by definition 2, above.
The possibility for California to
abolish a racist measure such as affirmative action shows that "the system" is not "inherently racist." Yet,
while Jones is surely not a racist by
definition 1, above, he advocates an
inherently racist policy.

cally with stated arguments.
Honestly, I do not know what it is
going to take for us to generate a more
purposeful and fulfilling mode ofcampus discourse. Until we stop looking
for the worst and start straining to
understand the value in each other's
views, we will never have motive
enough to honestly represent each
other's views to ourselves, let alone
to others.
The issue of support groups is a
sensitive one, and rightly so. This is a

community still seeking to become
whatithas never been before—genuinely inclusive and supportive ofall.
When we cannot talk without impugning, however, the future of all
our community resources is imperiled, not by the malicious plotting of
some dastardly renegades in student
government, but by the spiteful sound
and fury of our partisan proclivities
in the public space.

1997 MULTICULTURAL
Participants in the
1997 Multicultural
Winter Institute offer
personal reactions to
and thoughts on the
experience...

Toki Redder

The Winter Institute was a refreshing break from thinking about
multiculturalism in an analytical and
impersonal way. Instead of reading
and discussing the theories of different authors, we instead used "I" statements so that every discussion was
grounded in our own personal experiences and perceptions. The formation of small "affinity groups" facilitated the discussion of intense and
sensitive issues by creating a space
where no one would be afraid to say
what they thought. Because of the
emphasis on respect and confidentiality, the Institite enabled me to embark on a personal journey where I
was able to reflect on my identity,
and to think about my role in social
change.
First, in our discussions aboutidentity, I thought about what it means to
be biracial. Being half-Japanese and
half-German, I sometimes feel excluded from both the Asian-American community and the dominant
white culture. By both groups, I have
been treated as an outsider, an infiltrator, or somehow racially impure.
Also, because of the rigidity of constructed racial categories, I feel forced
to choose between identifying myself as either a white person or as a
person of color, and I am always
reluctant to do so, because I feel like
I am denying the other half of my
identity.
The Winter Institute was not only a
place where I could reaffirm the indivisibility ofmy identity as a biracial

person, but it also gave me a new
perspective on activism. In the past, I
have often felt guilty about not doing
enough for a given political cause,
for not taking concrete action in
fighting oppression, for withdrawing
in frustrated apathy in the face of
pervasive inequalities. At the Institute, however, I learned that I have
the capacity to create social change
without necessarily being a dedicated
political activist or
organizer. I can
strive to be an understanding listener
in everyday interactions and to work at
equality and respect
in interpersonal relationships. I can
be aware of the stereotypes I unconsciously harbour towards others and
take risks in reaching out to people
who are different
from myself.
The Winter Institute taught me that
we can be personal
activists by living
according to our vision of a more just
society. Because
honesty and respect
formed the basis of
the dialogue at the
Winter Institute, I
left with a greater
understanding of
myself and, more
importantly, an appreciation for the
stories, opinions, and insights that
had been shared with me.

The MulticulturalWinter Institute
stands out amongst my past endeavors within workshops, discussions,
and learning retreats as one of the
most productive, intense, and em-

powering programs in which I've
taken part. Not only was it a valuable
exercise in cross-cultural communication and connection, but it elicited
a very introspective and thought-provoking dimension, which continues
to shape and transform my outlook
today. I chose to participate in the
Institute because I cared deeply about
issues of discrimination, ignorance,
and cross-cultural abuse. Having

pride in being open-minded, he/she
may in fact be closing the mind to
further openness, awareness, and development. Not only did my experiences in the Institute open my eyes to
realities I'd previously overlooked,
they fostered a realization that despite feeling greatly enriched and
transformed, I still have much to
learn and understand about oppression and my potential role in addressing it.
Only through
continuously
looking inward and undergoing a
process of
honest selfevaluation
can I attain a
sense
of
pride in who
I am, competence in directly seeing
conand
fronting injustice, and a
degree of integrity and
self-awareness necessary in truly

past, I expected to encounter a certain
degree of familiarity and predictability in the topics and concerns addressed. Little did I know how much
I had to learn.
. Perhaps one of the most dangerous
and stagnant forms of ignorance resides in those who are not cognizant
of their lack of awareness, who consider themselves enlightened and,
thus, despite good intentions, contribute to the problem rather than the
solution. It's not always easy to accept that the minute a person takes

listening to
and empathizing with
the experiences of others. Institute
participants
taught me
much about taking risks, remaining
open to vulnerability in the face of
fear, and assuming responsibility
without designating fault
tools
which are invaluable in the pursuit of
multicultural understanding and appreciation.
The Winter Institute was not
merely a gratifying social bonding
experience. At times, our activities,
discussions, and periods of sharing
left me feeling troubled, disturbed,
confused, guilty, angry, and even
bitter. While these emotions may be
familiar to anyone subjected to un-

fair prejudice or typification, I often
have the luxury of placing them aside
until I have the time and energy to
devote to them (ie. after applications
and finals). Throughout this intensive four days, however, I could not
escape the negative sensations and
frustrations, nor did I want to, since it
was through them that I was able to
recognize their origins within myself
and make active choices about how to
deal with them most constructively.
What most struck me about the Institute was the feeling with which I departed of connection, growth, and
empowerment on a very practical and
substantial level. My challenge and
aspiration now involves incorporating these experiences and lessons in
my daily choices in large and small
ways, embracing a commitment to
constructive action and positive
change inwardly and outwardly, and
making conscious, ethical choices
while retaining an awareness of my
responsibility to act and the consequences of failing to act.

Swatties talk theory. We talk race,
we talk culture. We talk about interlocking systems of oppression. We
talk talk talk and frankly we're all a
little sick ofit. But when do we really
talk and when do we really listen?
How isolated have we become in the
academization ofoppressive assumptions? In other words, how many
people on this campus communicate
honestly about the terrifying topics
of difference and oppression with
people of otherraces, genders, classes,
religions, sexual orientations, or even
positions within the college?
Swatties talked in the Winter Institute. In retrospect, I am faced with the
difficulty of expressing in a handful
of paragraphs what a group of people
struggled with, on courageous and
intimate levels for four long/short
days. What I can say with certainty is
that real things happened, that I
learned to examine my own history,

that I see how far I have to go in
working on my own assumptions,
and that I left with an understanding
of whatkinds of groundwork need to
be done for meaningful alliancebuilding both inside and out of our
little bubble.
Real pain lives here, and real possibility. It begins with opening the
lines of communication, and no, it's
not all about talk. It's about confronting the scars we inflict upon ourselves and others, through talking in
order to see in order to change. Can
Swatties make the leap to action? The
Winter Institute says yes. As Michael
Eric Dyson explains, "Postmodern
theory of identity does help us appreciate the danger of fragmentation,
but it also suggests the possibility of
change. It says, think of yourself as a
project, an experiment in the making.
What you used to be you don't always have to be."

I had come back from a relatively
long break, prepared to work hard.
My determination was worn down as
the Winter Institute began and continued for four consecutive days. How
was the Institute intense?
People cried. People, having come
very enthused and some ready to talk
up a storm became subdued and
thoughtful. The Winter Institute was
definitely a time for reflection. The
most memorable exercises we did
were the mask game and the museum
of stereotypes. During the mask
game, people wearing masks (half
the group) were asked to raise their
hands when they wanted to speak and
address all the individuals not wearing a mask formally (using Mr. or
Mrs). Meanwhile, those not wearing
masks were allowed to call out, address eachother simply by first names,
and also have the privilege of stopping any masked person from talking. The task of the group was to

College Community To Remember History Professor

Memorial Service to be Held for Professor Jerome Wood
By

Jessica Harbour

Today

at 4:30 p.m., the College will
hold amemorial service in honor ofthe
late Jerome H. Wood Jr., Professor
Emeritus of History, who died December 15
of cardiac arrest. Wood, who was 55, joined
the College faculty in 1970 and taught Latin
American and colonial American history until
the spring of 1996, when he retired due to
failing eyesight.
Born in Washington, D.C., Wood earned
his B.A. summa cum laude from Howard
University in 1962, the year he was named a
Woodrow Wilson Fellow, and his Ph.D. in
American Civilization from Brown University in 1969. Before coming to Swarthmore,
he taughtatTemple University and Haverford

College. He spoke both Spanish and Portuguese fluently and helped found the new
Latin American Studies Concentration. In
part because of his efforts, the History Department is currently searching for a specialist in Latin American history. Wood was a
Fulbright-Hays Fellow in 1980, traveling
throughout Latin America, and a Fulbright
lecturer in American history at Nankai University, the People's Republic of China, in
1983-1984.
In addition to his extensive academic
achievements, Wood was deeply involved in
both the College and his home community. A
resident of Aldan, he was very active in the
Aldan Civic Association and he'd a position
on the board of the Lansdowne Symphony
Orchestra. He also served as Associate Pro-

vost of the College from 1986 to 1989; Wood
also participated in both the Black Studies
Committee and the Sager Committee and
helped develop the College's study abroad
programs.
"The College [has] lost a dear friend, a vital
teacher and scholar, and a pioneer," said
President Al Bloom in a public statement
dated January 22. "He...was the source of

Swat Prepares for Luke's Return
By

Josh Kramer

S

watties will stream offcampus today in
a demonstrationof nostalgic fever for a
movie that was deemed one of the
best...of a previous decade. The myth and
legend that surrounds George Lucas' Sci-Fi
classic Star Wars, and its 1997 makeoverand
re-release is unheard of, with an expected box
office turnout that may rival the original's
success. Star Wars will be released today,
The Empire Strikes Back on February 21,
and, on March 14, Return Of The Jedi.
Three groups ofSwarthmore students plan
to attend showings of Star Wars. SWIL already has tickets to the Friday premiere.
Larry Miller '9B, the organizer of the SWIL
trip, and a self-proclaimed Star Wars groupie,
was three years old when it first came out.
Miller did see Star Wars again, and said that
"I'm seeing it again because I'm a sucker."
The residents of Parrish fourth and third
are also planning a trip. John Christodouleas
'9B, said thathe was planning on getting a van
"sometime in the middle of next week...
when therush has dieddown." Christodouleas
was unclear as to why he wanted to go, and
eventually decided that he wanted to learn
more of the myth of Anakin Sky walker.
Finally, the residents of Dana, Hallowell
and Mary Lyon have apparently bought out
an entire movie theater on Saturday afternoon, with intends to fill it With residents.
Though the organizers of this trip could not
be contacted, Jordan Hay '9B statedthat they

had already purchased tickets and had arranged for private transportation, as all the
Student Council vans were booked.
Star Wars has always had a great following. Joel McNary '9B, in fact, was able to base
an entire religion paper around the moral
legitimacy of the Star Wars rebellion. In the
end, McNary found that the war was certainly
legitimate, which was apparent to those of us
who saw the characters—I mean, who really
can support people who wear all black, and
dump their children on foreign planets for
decades?
The moral patterns in Star Wars run deeper
than just a method of analysis. When originally creating the trilogy, Lucas looked to
many religions and philosophies to create his
"force" metaphor. According to McNary, the
force was "modeled on a conglomeration of
various religions... you can see certain Asian
religions and certain Western ones."
What is it that makes these re-released
movies so attractive? To some, like
Christodouleas, it is the prospect of new
material. However, in the pre-release Webbased information, Lucasfilm states that only
one new scene had been added—an early
meeting between Jabba and Han to set up the
later carbon-freezing.
In The Empire Strikes Back, only several
seconds of previously unseen footage will be
released. For The Return Of The Jedi, however, the entire end sequence, the Ewok celebration, has been extended with new music
and special effects to showcase a celebration

going on throughout the whole Star Wars
galaxy.
On the otherhand, special effectsbuffs will
be greatly pleased with some new sequences,
with new dinosaur-like creatures on Tattoine,
Luke's home planet and especially exciting
computer-generatedspaceships, whichlooked
much like those in Babylon 5.
Also, the films have had a total visual and
sound make-over. The sound is now in thunderous THX, and the crispness of the colors
should look better than the original releases.
For fans of the original scores by John
Williams, RCA has released three 2-CD sets
featuring every second of music in the movies sequenced chronologically, with enhanced
sound quality and unreleased music.
The highly-anticipated new installments
of Star Wars are now expected out in 1999.
Lucas plans to film them on specially-designed soundstages that will allow him to
actually digitally extend the set, creating a
whole new environment for motion pictures.
In the end, this re-release of a sci-fi classic
trilogy has generated hype unheard of, especially for a movie that was from the Seventies.Kudos to the producers—this sci-fi classic, while requiring people to get three entire
tickets, required little in terms of funding for
cast, crew and the like—most of the filming
was already complete. Personally, I'm waiting for the next installment of Star Wars, and
sitting at home with my VCR while everyone
else shells out fifteen dollars to see an old
movie.

prioritize a list offifteen items on the national
agenda. What was the point of this exercise?
The point of the exercise was to make the
participants understand one of the dynamics
of society which is the privilege of some and
the oppression of others. Usually, those in
society who have privilege are male heterosexual whites, especially ifthey are wealthy.
Those oppressed include everyone else, but
specifically minorities based on ethnicity.
The agenda was never prioritized because
there was too much quarreling about the
inequality of rights for the masked people.
There was no justifiable reason why the
masked should be treated differently from
those who were unmasked—those were the
rules of the game, but there was the question
of where those rules came from. Why should
we have to follow those rules? It was decided
unanimously that the masked people should
no longer have to raise their hands to speak or
address unmasked people formally.
The second exercise was the stereotype
museum. Participants were given slips of
paper with a differentracial group or sexual
identity typed on it (such as gays and lesbians, blacks, whites, hispanics and Jews), and
participants were asked to write everything
that came to their minds when they read those
words. We could identify stereotypes, slurs,
or anything, whether we thought they were
good or bad. These slips were collected and
what we wrote was copied onto big sheets of
paper which were posted up alongside the
wall of our room. We were then asked to take
a look at the "exhibition" and gather around
to express how we felt. Everyone, absolutely
everyone, said they felt either sick, saddened,
depressed, or hopeless—most of what was
written up were derogatory remarks.
The Winter Institute was intense in a subtle
way. As soon as classes began, I felt drained
ofenergy. I thought a lot about the responsibilities which we talked about in the Institute
such as forming alliances to end oppression.
I thought a lot about how I could play thatrole
to the extent that I could not even focus on my
work—to that extent, thinking so much about
this responsibility was detrimental.
To this point, in order to be able to focus on
my schoolwork, I have to say to my self that as
long as I listen compassionately to whatpeople
from all backgrounds have to say, and ifI can,
say any words that may alleviate ignorance,
I will be taking responsibility.
However, I believe that ignorance is too

widespread for single individuals to make an
impressionable impact on society at large.
That is not to say that individual acts aren't
significant or worthwhile. But people who
have the resources to reach large numbers of
people can be more in tune with the oppression that is going on and inform and educate.
I believe many people at Swarthmore may be
some of those people in the future.

tension...anxiety...trembling and, overall,
fear...(deep breath and then smile)...forced
confidence...lwavered betweenall these emotions as I stepped into the ScheuerRoom that
first day. (As you, the Swattie, would be
smart enough to perceive, this essay is indeed
about revealing emotions). I am not quite
sure what to say, except that my apprehension contrasted with my desire for social
interaction and even for a little self-revelation.
The next four days of the Winter Institute
were a blur: so many activities and so many
issues in such a short period of time intensified and confused any emotions that I felt.
However, one activity did stand out in my
mind: reading the list of sterotypes that the
group generated. Intially, I agreed with some
of them. I probably am the geekiest Asian girl
you'll ever meet and my relatives really do
want theirkids to become doctors. But that's
not to say that I wasn't hurt by many other
stereotypes or that I wasn't embarrassed that
we humans actually entertain ourselves by
hurting our fellow beings. Sometimes, I wonder if Joseph Conrad isn't entirely wrong,
that we all have a little bit of darkness inside
of us.
What struck me even more was the question that our facilitator asked: how do you
feel when you hear these stereotypes? Furthermore, she stated that shedidn't want us to
reason or to think about the meanings behind
those stereotypes but rather to express how
we feel. Especially in an academic setting
like Swarthmore, we often tend to embrace
Spock-like notions of communication. The
emphasis is on logic and emotions are secondary.
From my own experiences, I can see that so
many standing conflicts stem from an inability to communicate properly and an unwillingness to risk showing emotions. Quite
frankly, I didn't want to write this article

because I was afraid that someone might
misunderstand what I had said or, even worse,
laugh at it. Words are something that I
remember and judge people by so I can definitely empathize with someone else's hypersensitivity about speaking his mind. Moreover, I was careful during our discussions
about choosing the correct words because I
didn't want to hurt anyone's feelings. As a
friend suggested, despite theWinterInstitute's
providing a safe haven for us to share our
feelings, the baggage we carried with us into
that room hampered our discussions. Often,
the silence in the room sent a more powerful
message about our alienation than the words
we used. And that is precisely the problem
we face.
I thinkmany conflicts are so deeply-rooted
in our community that we cannot find concrete solutions. Similarly, I couldn't think of
an appropriate closing to this essay. But,
perhaps, Maslow's goal of human epiphany
is a process rather than a result ofrisk-taking
or emotional discovery. Maybe, his pyramid
has no real ending (kind oflike this essay). I
know one thing for sure: I may never fully
reach self-actualizationbut I am getting there.
I've learned that I am guilty of numerous
things that I accuse others of doing, namely
stereotyping and that I'm not as accepting of
others as I thought.

Kirstin Lindermayer '99
A circle of us sat on the floor of Parrish

Fourth. We were weary from the day thathad
ended, but still we talked and talked ...about
what we can do to work against discrimination at Swarthmore. It was amazing enough
that a group of forty people wanted to spend
the last days of break talking about diversity,
but to see that they wanted to continue the
conversations into the night was incredible...
I didn'tknow exactly what to expect on the
first day ofthe Winter Institute.What I wanted
most was to talk and to talk freely and to be
honest and to say what'sbeen on my mind for
the entire time that I've been at Swarthmore.
What I found was the beginning of a personaland collective journey. Each daybrought
new realizations about the life that I have
been living, the life thatI have always thought
I know well, and now I realize that there are
many parts to my own identity that are unfamiliar. I had never heard of white privilege. I
take it for granted that I walk into a store and
am hardly ever followed, and it wasn't until
I heard so many stories about the discrimination that minorities receive, that I realized
that yes, I am privileged and yes, I am white,
and yes, I am privileged because I am white.

"Nobody here is interested in war. We just
want to make some money," said Fedahija

Suvalic, a demobilizedMuslim soldier, as he
bartered with a Serb customer over a case of
Croatian brandy. "We arejust ordinary people
who didn't ever want there to be a war,"
agreed one of his customers, Zoran Sljokic,
35, a Serb who also traded his fatigues for a
business suit."
The Philadelphia Inquirer, January 24,
1997
As I read this article concerning Americanstyle bargain shopping that occurs every day
in Bosnia, I wondered what we are thinking
when we decide either to trade or to fight with
another human being. Why does it sometimes happen that despite our own pain from
discrimination and hatred, we can reach out
to others, empathize and make friends and,
yet other times we reinforce our feelings of
—

superiority through domination.
It seems we walk a thin line between empathy and domination, since both are influenced by our natural desire to want to belong—to be part of a group. Are we aware
that with every action and word, we are
choosing either to empathize or discriminate? We can belong to a group only when
there is a sense of equality. Two people
bartering can be equals who freely exchange
thoughts and come to a mutually agreed upon
arrangement. In that small moment of time,
they understand each other, which fosters a
sense of belonging and friendliness. They
know each other. They are equals. The Winter Institute provided the knowledge to be
able to make a conscious choice between
empathy and rejection and in choosing a
willingness to feel with each other, becoming
equals.

At first, this made me feel uncomfortable
and I wanted to recede into the background.
How do I show that I don't want this privilege, that I never asked for it or deserved it?
What was wonderful about the Institute, was
that everyone understood that. I didn't feel
resented and am slowly learning that I may
not be deserving of my rights in our society,
and I may wish for a life without them, but
that makes me no less responsible for having
them...and for changing them. I was never
made to feel guilty for being white, but I was
also asked not to deny it, and that's critical for
moving past ignorance and stagnancy...we
cannot deny difference to promote equality.
One of the most moving moments was the
stereotypes museum. We gazed at huge sheets
of paper laced with word after word about
different groups. What was frightening was
that we had produced these lists ourselves,
from the words we have grown up with, and
the volume and repetition showed how ingrained stereotypes are and perhaps what was
scariest ofall was that I too have been guilty.
I think it's difficult to live in our country and
not be. Many of the stereotypes written about
white people have resonated in my head; I
don't know how it is that we can fight for
diversity if we stereotype our own identity
groups. We each walked proudly to the center
of the room and declared what about ourselves we are proud ofand some people cried
and many people laughed and we ripped up
the pieces ofpaper in the end together, knowing that it is now time to do so much more.
On the last day, I found myself close to
tears because around me were forty people
who I could be honest with and connect with
and I didn't want it to end, but knew that our
minds were crying for rest and that we had to
take a final grasp of what we gave and were
given and keep it with us. I wanted to thank
everyone, although I never overcame my
shyness, for making me feel so alive. For the
first time, I came close to cutting people off
and nearly jumped out of my skin to share
experiences and ask questions. I left the Institute with a commitment to recognize that
Swarthmore needs changing, to acknowledge this without blaming anyone, to keep
talking, to be more sensitive and aware in my
relationships and, above all else, to see the
wonderful people I met and smile and remember everything that they have taught me.

I was, sitting at my desk several
Thursdays ago, sifting through my email, when I noticed a message from
Josh in the In box. It was the only non"Reserved Students" message, so I curiously
double-clicked it.
As I scanned the lines of text, I discovered
that Josh, a former classmate of mine, had
written to wish me well and make sure that
everything was okay. It was the usual, "Hi,
how are you, I'm-sure-you're-working-hardand-so-am-I," greeting. How nice, I thought.
But there, at the end, sat a few words that
caught my eye and made my heart jump.
They were the words I longed to hear the
ones that invoked in me a sense of pride,
accomplishment, and egotism.
Hey Dave, I like your page.
Yes, he saw the URL! He read through my
witty and profound signature and decided to

proceeded to type in his address. I suppose
I'll just humor him and glance at his page, I

My head sunk slowly into my hands, and I
closed my eyes in despair. I had been defeated.
Personal webpages clutter the WorldWide

both act as somewhat of a refuge for their

its reputation of being a mecca for the economically-oriented, the World Wide Web is

The Web means different things to different people. In terms of appealing to the masses,

and they must be excused for their blindness
to the sour cream, potatoes, and other insidious contaminants that have diluted what is
truly Tex-Mex.
Tex-Mex rests perilously upon the lofty
peak of a mountain dividing America from
Mexico; lest you add too much ofAmerica or
remove too much of Mexico, the Holy Taco
will fall from its graceful heterogeneous
heights into the oblivion of uniculturalism.
With the infamous Enchirito and dreadful
Seven-Layer Burrito, Taco Bell made this
error, and can never turn back.
Taco House, located on Pine Street between 12th and 13th Street, luckily hasn't
made this same mistake It looks closed 24
hours a day, but it's not, so don't be discouraged by the steamy window (there's only
one) and closed door—go on in anyway.
Unkempt cooks and an ostensibly unsanitary
kitchen seem to be the rule here. The men's
bathroom is accessible only by walking
through the cellar, where much of the food is
stored.
Tex-Mex is a delicate art and not a venture
for the masses; the successes are few among
the vast pool of attempts. Finding the balance
between Mexico and America isn't easy. It's
especially difficult when both the clientele
and staff of a restaurant are Hispanic, which
tends to skew the balance incorrigibly to one
side. Luckily, for Taco House, this isn't the
case. The staff looks like a bunch of white
college kids. Normally this complete dearth
of the Mex would leave only the Tex, but
Taco House nonetheless is replete with both
Tex and Mex. What it lacks in foreigners, it
makes up with delicious food and futile attempts at interior decoration.
Lining the walls are a number of paintings
undoubtedly sponsored by the Philadelphia
Optometrists Society, because the images
they present are exactly what most people
look like to me when I'm not wearing my
glasses. The paintings are for sale too, though
I don't really understand why. But that's
beside the point: the reason you should go to
Taco House the first chance you get is because the food is sumptuous! The beans are
suitably spicy, and therice sufficiently clumpy
(none of that Uncle Ben's stuff). All of the

one complain in the severalparties with which
I have dined there. Vegetarian meals are
available, as is lots of meat.
Discovering a genuinely tasty Tex-Mex
restaurant has become something of a personal quest for me since the demise of the
legendary San Jose's in southeast Atlanta.
San Jose's was housed in a turquoise cinderblock building slightly larger than a Willets
quad and run by a crew of first-generation
immigrants. But they didn't make the mistake sufferedby Tequila's in downtownPhilly,
which has doomed itself to the condemnation
of the truly multicultural (e.g., me) in its
attempts to offer "genuine" Mexican food.
The guys at San Jose's served true TexMex, balanced gingerly on the line between
two disparate societies, and they served it in
style. The bathrooms of San Jose's were
straight out of Mexico City (In fairness, I
should clarify that the bathrooms resembled
what I think public restrooms in a city of 25
million would look like) and the dining-room
was cleaned regularly on the third Thursday
of every month. Sanitation evidently had no
translation into the Spanish spoken at San
Jose's. Despite this, the food was immaculate
and impeccably clean; you wouldn't have
guessed the state ofthe kitchen by trying one
of their tacos.
When business started to boom, San Jose's
owners attempted to build an outside deck,
constructed from cinder blocks, scrap wood,
and sheets of plywood. The addition of the
deck almost doubled the serving area, but for
only a short time. Soon after, during the end
of its operating days, the restaurant began to
receive regular visits from the city health
inspectors. Several health inspections and
one collapsed deck later, San Jose's was out
of business.
From eating at San Jose's for years, and
after numerous attempts at finding a suitable
replacement, I've deducedthe universal relationship between sanitation and taste, which
I call Joe's Constant. There is an inverse
correlation between a clean restaurant and
good food: the more attention they give to the
bathroom, the less attention they give to the
food. When you enter a new restaurant, the
quickest way to find out how good the food is
to survey the bathrooms; if they're clean,
you're in the wrong place. I have yet to find
an exception to this rule.
Which brings me back to Taco House. It's
a great dining experience. Give this place a
try the next timeyou're in Center City: 1218
Pine Street, phone (215) 735-1880. Since the
demise of San Jose's, there is no better TexMex. Just watch out for the bathroom.

Blaxploitation Genre

Patrick "Black Belt" Runkle
By

"This film has redefined the role of women
in cinemaand will continue to be the embodiment of the modern feminist movement for
many years to come."
"Not since Langston Hughes' death has a
work of art so sensitively redefined interracial relationships and so effectively broken
down racial stereotypes."
"This film is NO FUN."
These are just some of the things F ve never
heard anyone sav about the two movies on the
bill for this weekend, Shaft and I'm Gonna
Git You Sucka. If you are overly sensitive to
violence, sex, sexism, or plots so thin that one
could floss with them, please get a good book
out of the library and avoid the PAC this
weekend. If not, call the babysitter, leave
your intellect at home, and go watch two of
the more enjoyable movies to be shown this
semester.

Shaft' s appearance in 1971 made it the first
of the blaxploitation genre. It was widely
enjoyed by both white and black audiences
alike. The sequels Shaft's Big Score! and
Shaft in Africa followed shortly after. In the
wake of the civil rights movement and the
success of black actors like Sidney Poitier,
Hollywood decided to take its own steps
towards rather dubious racial equality: to
release bad films aimed specifically at African-American audiences, instead of just bad
films aimed at white audiences.
The history of Shaft is rather interesting,
but the plot is not. John Shaft is an AfricanAmerican private detective in New York.
After Shaft is approached by police asking
him to inform on local gangs and attacked by
two members of a gang run by a man named
Bumpy, he becomes embroiled in a war in the
criminal underworld of New York.
Shaft is led first to fight against Bumpy,
then a black militant group,and finally, allied
with both, he learns his true enemy is the
white Mafia. He must rescue a beautiful
woman, daughter to Bumpy, who is being
held hostage by the Mafia. I don't mean to kill
the suspense, (sensitive readers who wish to
be surprised, please squint a lot while reading
the next lines, so the surprise ending will not
be revealed) but he does so, with great bravado and about 1600 metric tons of bullets.
And therein lies the secret magic of Shaft.
Not in the plot, but in his flair. He doesn't take
anything from anyone, black or white. He
makes his own rules; he lives in his own

world. He can control anyone he wants. He
can make it with any woman he meets, and
frequently does so.
And he is one snappy dresser.
Another secret weapon of Shaft is the
Oscar- and Grammy-winning soundtrack,
written and performed by Isaac Hayes. Hayes
is credited by some as one of the originators
ofrap. Hisfunk bass lines and smooth rhythms
create an unforgettable score for this movie,
expressing the true ambience of John Shaft
better than any words can.
On a sad historical note, though Shaft stood
up to Whitey and lived on his own terms, the
real Shaft, Richard Roundtree, performed in
the film for only $ 13,000. The film went on to
make over $7 million. Roundtree never was
able to live down his Shaft stereotype and
never got another role with the prominence or
potential ofShaft. No matter how comic Shaft
may seem to us now, one can't forget that the
racism that Shaft fights is still very real.
In short, Shaft is a hell of a fun movie. A
must-see foranyone who actually did or ever
wanted to live through the seventies. It will be
a treat for old Shaft fans to see it on the big
screen and recite the lines along with
Roundtree. And for newcomers to Shaft, I'll
teach you...
Hayes says: "They say this cat Shaft is one
bad mother..."
You say: "Shut your mouth!"
Hayes says: "But I'm just talking about
Shaft!"
You say: "Then we can digit!"
After seeing the original Shaft tonight, tomorrow night you can check out Keenan
Ivory Wayans' 1988 spoof of the
blaxploitation genre in general, and Shaft in
particular, in I'm Gonna Git You Sucka, a
movie just as ambitious and hilarious as its
title.
Wayans plays Jack Spade, a young man
returning to his ghetto neighborhood from the
army. Hefinds his brother June Bug dead and
decides to take on the local crime syndicate
led by Mr. Big. Joining him is his boyhood
hero, John Slade (Bernie Casey), who fought
crime in the neighborhood in the '7os. Also
joining him are blaxploitation regulars Jim
Brown and Issac Hayes.
The movie is lots of fun. Wayans is his
normal high-spirited self, here functioning as
writer, director, and star, and he knows the
material he's spoofing well. He has lots offun
with the genre, from the virile black male
stereotype to the tacky sets to the funky music. And while he does get the babe, that scene
isn't as much sexy as sidesplitting.
As Jack and his team break into Mr. Big's
UrbanFortress, Wayans displays gifted comic
timing and some great filmmaking skill. Trust
me, this movie will really, really make you
laugh out loud. And, just for fun, you can
check out the parade offuture Wayans family
stars in this movie: Damon, Marlon, and
Shawn. So, kick back and have a good time,
and stay cool.

Newspaper

If

you're reading this, you probably know
that The Phoenix is no longer placed
lovingly in your mailbox by a Phoenix
staff member. And while the staff officially
maintains that this new policy of placing the
paper in bins within the mail room was conceived in order to save time, paper, and
money, I think we all know the real reason
why you are not getting your Phoenix anymore. It's censorship, plain and simple.
Knowledge is power, my friends. This is an
elaborate plan concocted by the Phoenix
staff to control the College and, ultimately,
your minds.
Heck, they know you are never going to pick
up and read the Phoenix on your own volition. Soon, you will have no idea what movie
should be playing over the weekend. They
will usurp the Movie Committee and start
playing their own propaganda films. Although
most of the Phoenix staff are skinny little
twerps, they will start naming themselves the
Athletes of the Week.
And don't think it will stop with their
control of the Phoenix. What do you think
has been happening up there in that tiny
office on the fifth floor of Parrish? I'll tell
you what they're doing up there: they're
training a Special Weapons Attack Team
(S.W.A.T.) whose sole mission is to gain
access to and control over the large beverage
refrigerators in Tarble, allowing them only
to be stocked with nasty Snapple Iced Tea
flavors like Yak Vomit and Ox Bile. And as
we all know, he who controls the beverages
controls the world.
So you're probably wondering what you
can do to thwart the Phoenix staffs evil
plans. Your life would be a pretty grim existence if you could not pick up a Hank's root
beer with your fingers and fries.
Well, the solution is pretty simple. All
you've got to do is remember to pick up a
Phoenix out of the bins in the mail room each

staff to control your minds.
week. The Phoenix staff will then see that
they do not have a monopoly over Swarthmore
information and will be forced to abort their
future plans.
But, as you're probably thinking, you now
have another problem as equally upsetting as
the first, for what are you going to do withthe
Phoenix after you pick it up? You can't just
throw it unopened into the recycling box like
you used to do because the staff will see the
Phoenixes sitting neatly stacked in the bins
and know that you still aren't reading the
paper.
I mean you surely are not going to start
reading the Phoenix, are you? Heck, I only
read myself, after all. How can I expect you
to do more? So, in order to solve this dilemma, I've come up with some ideas concerning what to do with the Phoenix other
than reading it.
Even though I know that a normal Swattie
owns over 40 pairs ofunderwear, sometimes
we just don't have enough time in a month
and a half to get down to the laundry room.
And I also know how difficult itis to get your
roommate out of the room in the morning so
that you can "borrow" a pair of his or her
skivvies. But if you start collecting the Phoenix, you will never have to worry about clean
underwear again. With the aid of a little
masking tape and a few delicately placed
staples, you've got a pair of clean, pseudocomfortable underwear that is completely
disposable. And, if class just gets a little too
boring that day, you can always open your
pants and read me!
Similar to your laundry problems, you
probably have not found the time to vacuum
the floor of your dorm room. Well, this
obstacle to cleanliness can easily be overcome by creating a faux floor out ofyour old
Phoenix newspapers. Just cover the floor
completely with the papers and, when the
paper becomes soiled with the dog poop you
accidentally stepped in on Parrish Beach or
whatever else your roommate dragged in,
merely throw away the old paper and put
down fresh sheets.This faux flooridea is also
beneficial for the roaches in your dorm, for it
gives them something to read while they're
depositing theireggs in your food or building
nests in your shoes. A mind, even though it
belongs to a roach, is a terriblething to waste.
Use the Phoenix to soak the oil off your
Renato's pizza. The fat you save could be
your own.
You can also use the Phoenix to wrapstuff.
Fish, for example. Or if you don't have any
fish to bind, you could always wrap presents
for me in the Phoenix. But ifyou dohave fish,
don't give it to me as a present, wrapped or
otherwise. I don't like fish.

SPORTS
Super Bowl? What Super Bowl?
By

Frank Amar

The NFL season finally came to a

conclusion last Sunday evening, with
the Green Bay Packers and the New

England Patriots meeting in the Big
Easy. The Packers, masters of the
NFC all season long, got to the big
dance with the NFL' s most explosive

offense, a steady defense, and big
play special teams after losing to
Dallas in last year's NFC championship game. The Pats,, on the other
hand, reboundedfrom a horrendous 5
win.l 1 loss last season to make their

first Super Bowl appearance since
their nightmarish 46-10 drubbing at
the hands of the Chicago Bears in
1986. The Pats relied on the arm of
Drew Bledsoe, one of the best young
quarterbacks in the game, the running of second year back Curtis Martin and an underrated defense.
The oddsmakers, weighing the
strength of the Packers and the recent
Super Bowl woes of the AFC, installed the Packers as two touchdown
favorites. Most of the media attention was focused on the Packers. Bill
Parcells diverted the glaring hot spotlight off of his team and onto his
future as coach of the Patriots, relieving his team of any undue pressure.
This Super Bowl was about dramatic momentum swings. The Packers made the oddsmakers look like
geniuses in the first five minutes of
the game.After the Pack's first drive
ended in a punt, Brett Favre connected with Andre Rison on their
second play. On the Pats' next drive,
Drew Bledsoe's pass was intercepted
and itlooked like the Pack was going
to blow the game wide open. After a
Chris Jacke field goal, the score stood
at 10-0.
A lesser team would have folded
the tent and gone home, but the
Patriots didn't get to the Super Bowl
by rolling over and dying. Abandoning the run, the Patriots sought to

narrow the gap through the air. With
the Patriots' front five giving Drew
Bledsoe ample protection, Bledsoe
was able to pick apart the Packers'
secondary. After touchdown passes
to Keith Byars and Ben Coates, the
Pats found themselves holding a 1410 lead and the momentum.
The second quarter belonged to the
Packers. Taking advantage of New
England miscues, the Pack was able
to add two more field goals before
Brett Favre scrambled for a touchdown in the final two minutes to
make the score 27-14 at halftime.
At this point, most people (including myself) had come to the conclusion that this game was over. All it
would take is a Packers touchdown
drive to start the second half to seal
the game. However, the Pack was
unable to put the Patriots away on
their first drive of the second half.
The Patriots, on the other hand,
mounted a drive deep into Green Bay
territory before capping it off with an
18 yard touchdown run by Curtis
Martin to make it 27-21. Then came
perhaps the most dramatic special
teams play in Super Bowl history
since Jim O'Brien's last second gamewinning field goal in Super Bowl V.
Desmond Howard, the 1991
Heisman Trophy winner, whose professional career could be labelled at
best uninspiring after stops in Washington and Jacksonville, had come to
the Packers this summer. His poor
work habits nearly cost him his jobin
training campitself. The Packers held
onto him, seeing him as a return specialist. Howard dazzled his way into
the NFL record books this season by
returning punts, and on this day, secured himself a position in Super
Bowl lore. Catching AdamViniateri' s
kickoff at the one yard line, Howard
sprinted forward, found a crack and
raced 99 yards to paydirt, giving the
Packers some breaming room and
smashing the dreams of the Patriots.

The Packers spent the rest of the
game trying to run the clock out,
while the Patriots tried in vain to
score. Reggie White showed why he
has been the NFL's dominant defensive player of the past decade, notching three sacks and making Drew
Bledsoe's life miserable.
Though it took the Packers 29 years
to get back to the Super Bowl, don't
look for them to take another 29 year
sabbatical. Las Vegas has already
installed them as 5-2 favorites to win
next year's Super Bowl. The Packers
have no real weakness except for
their offensive line, where they
shuttled in several different starters
throughout the year. Look for them to
address this area in the draft. The
Cowboys and 49ers appear to be in a
state ofminor decline, and there is no
other team in the NFC who appears
ready to fill the void, with the possible exception of the Carolina Panthers. Don't look for a dramatic improvement of the next tier of teams,
like the Chicago Bears, Minnesota
Vikings and the Philadelphia Eagles.
In the unpredictable AFC, the only
thing that seems certain is that they
will lose the Super Bowl again. For
all the money Denver spent to improve its defense, it looked awfully
pathetic in their shocking loss to Jacksonville. The Pittsburgh Steelers
should be just as good next year, but
until their quarterback situation is
resolved, they don't have a chance of
winning a Super Bowl. The Kansas
City Chiefs and Buffalo Bills, the
cream of the AFC crop throughout
this decade, both are in a state of
confusion. Jacksonville and New England are relatively young teams
which should only get better. After
that, there seems to be a cast of mediocre teams like Oakland, Indianapolis, Houston, Cincinnati, and Miami
that could make some noise.
Remember, it's only six months
till the first pre-season game.

Super Bowl Commentary

Pack Fan Shows True Colors
By Tony

Sturm

So the Green Bay Packers won
their first SuperBowl in 29 years, and
the New England Patriots lost their
second in 11 years last Sunday at the
Superdome in New Orleans. I will
confess right now that I have been a
die-hard Packers fan since I was sucking at my mother's teat, and that I am
not going to pretend to be unbiased
about this game. The Packers
Rule!!!!!
Okay, enough of that. You probably saw me wearing my cheesehead
around campus in the days before the
game. That was just to pledge my
allegiance to the Pack, and I realized
that I am generally in enemy territory
here, so I decided not to wear it after
the game, since some of the Patriots
fans I know are way bigger than me
and would probably consider it (correctly) gloating if I wore the
cheesehead after the game and beat
me up, so my hat is now proudly
displayed on the floor ofmy room.
The NFC won the Super Bowl for
the 12th straight year. One thing that
seems to baffle about everybody is
how the AFC can play so competitively during the season then get
whupped in the Superbowl season
after season. Very few people gave
the Patriots a chance, and many were
criticizing the Packers for winning
by "only" 14 points. The Packers
matched the spread exactly, making
thousandsof illegal bookies who play
tie goes to the house very rich. The
AFC wins the Pro Bowl each year,
but the NFC wins the Superbowl by
an average score of like 20 points.
Maybe the AFC is always saving
itself for the wrong game?
The game was played in the New
Orleans Superdome, offending many
football purists; the same type of
people who gripe that nobody drop
kicks any more. But seriously, we
went from the frozen tundra of
Lambeau Field to the 68 degree plastic carpet of the Superdome. Most
people agree that domes are lame,
and I still think thatit is a travesty that
a stadium as lame as the Superdome
got both the NCAA College Football
championship game and the Super
Bowl this year. But then, I am still
waiting for the Super Bowl to venture
north of the Mason-Dixon line.
About that game...the Packers
played the first ten minutes looking
absolutely unstoppable. But then the
underdogs surprised everyone and
scored two quick touchdowns and
suddenly everyone.was wondering if
New England could somehow pull it
off. The answer was no, as Green Bay
answered with some of the longest

about two minutes ago. Well, those
ads must work on someone because I
cannot remember any of them.
The halftime show was something
interesting as well. One ofmy friends

Flying High on Recent Wins
David Lischer

After trailing by five points at halftime and by as much as 13 points in
the second half, the Swarthmore
men's basketball team went on a 214 run to defeat Philadelphia Pharmacy 64-56 and extend its winning
streak to three games.
"We outscored them 21-4 in the
last ten minutes in their gym. Our
guys really stepped up at money time,"
said Coach Lee Wimberly.
For the second time in as many
years, Swarthmore (9-8,4-3) has defeated a very strong team from Pharmacy, who were 12-4 before Wednesday night's loss.
Swarthmore's three game winning
streak has followed a period after
winter break in which they lost four
games, including three to Centennial
Conference opponents.
"We're executing a little bit better
now [on offense]... but our defense
has played pretty consistently even
when we were losing," said Coach
Wimberly.
Tim Schofield '9B and J.J. Purdy
'9B deserve credit for limiting Shannon Overton, Pharmacy's best player
and who Coach Wimberly calls one
of the better players the team faces all
year, to only eight points on three of
11 shooting.
Purdy and Michael Schall '9B have
seen their minutes increase with the
loss offorward Jeff Greeson '97. The
loss of 6'5" Greeson will hurt the
Garnet, who were already one of the
shorter teams in the conference.
The Garnet defense is ranked third
best in the conference in field goal
percentage allowed (41.7%). For the
last two games it has held opponents
to under 40% shooting to the field, a
figure which will almost always guarantee a win or a close game.
Against Pharmacy the Garnet harassed their opponents into a pathetic
31 % shooting in the second half. This
performance helped key the Garnet
come-from-behind victory.
On offense, the Garnet has been

Do you hunker down from the cold

No—you take a leisurely run

Celebrating Its First-Ever Win over W. Maryland
By

Jean Quinn

Swarthmore faced a challenging
schedule this week, taking on Western Maryland and Muhlenberg. Both
teams are currently in second place in
their divisions.
The Garnet defeated Western
Maryland 60-59 butfell to the Mules
67-53. Swarthmore's record is now
6-8 overall, and at 3-5 in the Centennial Conference, they are firmly in
third place.
Coming off a disappointing loss to
Ursinus, the first-place team in the
Eastern Division, the Garnetcame to
the court ready for action to take on
the GreenTerrorfrom Western Maryland.
Swarthmore exploded from the tipoff and collected a fourteen point
halftime lead. The Green Terror were
clearly taking the game lightly and
warmed up only minimally.

After halftime, the Terror applied
full-court pressure. Although Swarthmore did lead the entire game,
Western Maryland's stifling defense
unnerved the Garnet and the huge
halftime lead deteriorated.
With less than 20 seconds remaining in the gameand with a three-point
cushion, the Garnet's strategy was to
allow a two-point shot but could definitely not incur a foul which could
result in a three point play.
The GreenTerror got the ball in the
hands of their 6'4" center at the high
post who scored off an uncontested
offensive rebound at the buzzer, but
their comeback had faltered by one
point.
Jean Quinn '99 shot 53 percent
from the field and led the Garnet with
16 points and nine rebounds. Threepoint specialist Holly Barton, the
sophomore guard, dished out a career-high six assists and connected

on three of six attempts from behind
the arc to finish the game with 13

points.
Lisl Cochran-Bond '97 chipped in
11 points and snagged seven boards,
as did Pia Houseal '97.
Quinn was named to the Centennial Conference's Weekly HonorRoll
for leading the Garnet to its first victory over the Green Terror ever.
"The Western Maryland game was
our best game of the season thus far.
It was crucial that we start strong, and
I definitely felt that every individual
came mentally prepared to win the
game," said Coach Adrienne Shibles.
Against their next competitor, the
Garnet did not fare as well. The team
failed to play a clean game, making
poor passes on offense and not shifting well on the defensive end of the

floor.
Bad officiating did not help matters either: virtually no calls were

made whenthe ball got into the posts
or on occasions when numerous players were entangled on the floor.
According to Coach Shibles, the
Mules made the most of the situation
and capitalized on the fact that the
referees were not calling anything
while Swarthmore's frustration only
intensified.
Muhlenberg's center scored 18
points and pulled down 24 boards to
boost her team to its 14point victory.
Cochran-Bond had 20points and nine
rebounds for the Garnet, and Houseal
had 10points for the night.
The Mules out-rebounded Swarthmore by ten, which Coach Shibles
felt was the biggest factor in
Muhlenberg's victory. On the offensive end, Swarthmore players needed
to follow the examples of CochranBond and Holly Baker '99 (six points)
who aggressively took the ball to the
basket.

Wrestling Garners 2 Wins in a Tri-Match
By

Jennifer Z. Chen

Swarthmore's wrestling team put
on an excellent performance at the
tri-matchthis past Saturday. The team
lost only to Gettysburg and collected
two wins against Muhlenberg and
Johns Hopkins.
Co-captain Adrian Wilson '99,
commented that "Gettysburg was not
a happy time because we were shut
out." The Garnet failed to register a
single win in the match. The Garnet
had to forfeit the 118pounds weightclass, as there was no Swattie to fill

that position. In the 126 pounds class,
the Gettysburg wrestler pinned Aaron
Hoffman '9B. Hoffman went on to
win against Muhlenberg but dropped
his match to Hopkins in a controversial, overtime decision.
Aaron Kobernick 'OO lost in a major decision to the 142 pounder from
Gettysburg,the athletics powerhouse.
Unfortunately, sophomore co-captain
Scott Timm lost in the 150 pounds
category against Gettysburg, on account of a concussion, which ended
his day.
Fellow captain Pete Balvanz '9B,
dropped his only loss of the day to his
158 lbs. Gettysburg opponent. His
performance that day showed thatthe
year hiatus did not affect his wrestling abilities. Alec Stall '9B returned
for his one-month only performance
in wrestling from a term abroad and
won his matches against Muhlenberg
and Hopkins.
Besides the overall improved performance of Swarthmore wrestlers,
Johns Hopkins was the match where
first-year Jesse Bean's intrepid performance against a wrestler who was
25 pounds heavier helped to guarantee the win over Hopkins. As both
team lacked 190 lbs. wrestlers, Swat
was prepared to forfeit the match;
however, Hopkins had counted on a
win on merits of just sending a wrestler, a 175 pounder, to the mat. Bean
asked the coach for the chance to
wrestle instead of a forfeit. He succeeded in pinning his opponent.
Following the two wins and one
loss this past Saturday, the team looks
forward to another tri-match against
Ursinus, Washington & Lee and
Western Maryland, tomorrow.

S.I.D.
Jean Quinn, the 5' 9 sophomore forward on the basketball team,
performed spectacularly this week. Leading the Lady Garnet to their

first-ever win over the Green Terror of Western Maryland University,
Jean made the Centennial Conference Honor Roll for the week of
January 20, 1997. She shot 53 percent from the field and garnered 16
points with 9 rebounds. Her teammate and roommate, Holly Baker '99,
commented, "Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman is a player who encourages
her teammates and leads by example both on and off the court." In
addition to her basketball skills, Jean has been an invaluable member of
The Phoenix Sports Section.

In Saturday's home matches against Muhlenberg, Gettysburg and
Johns Hopkins, Jesse showed great courage and won respect from his
teammates, coaches and opponents. Wrestling is a sport with great
emphasis on body weight; each wrestlerhas to fit into a specific weight
category. Jesse, who regularly wrestles in either the 150 or 158 pound
weight-class, volunteered to wrestle a Hopkins wrestler who outweighed him by 25 pounds in order to keep Swarthmore in contention
for a win. Co-Captain Scott Timm '99 said, "Bulldog has a great
attitude, great work ethics. He wrestled hisbest matchof the season that
night. If it weren't for him, we would have lost the match."

women's badminton team, whose
number has grown to almost twice
the size it was last year, has so far
played a home match against the
Academy ofNew Church and an away
game against Bryn Mawr.
Tuesday, the women celebrated the
start of the season by pulling a devastating 5-0 win over ANC.
First singles player and team captain Thanh Hoang '97 quickly triumphed over ANC's Ruth Homber

Tepavcevic lost her first game 111, but in a burst of determination
and skill closed the gap considerably
by ending her second game 10-12.
At second doubles, Johansen and
Chen hung tight in a close match that
went to a deciding third game. The
third game was so hotly contested
that the duo was forced into sudden
overtime in the form of a five-pointswins-all shoot-out. Despite long rallies and miraculous saves, Bryn Mawr
