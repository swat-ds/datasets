On Monday, November 24, Swarthmore
requested that head football coach and tenured professor of physical education, Karl
Miran, resign from his coaching position
which he has held for the past eight years.
After two winless football seasons, the College came to the decision that the football
program could best be rebuilt under new
leadership. President Al Bloom, released
a statement which testified to Miran's
knowledge of the game and dedication to
the College. Bloom described Miran as "a
deeply respected and appreciated member
of this community" but went on to explain
that "at this critical moment in the history
of the program, it was our strong sense that
it was important to seek new leadership."
A meeting was called for all football
players on Monday night at Bpm to announce his resignation. At 7:3opm, after
considering the situation, Miran called
Bloom, explaining that he did not believe
this was what was best for him or the College. He indicated that he would not in-

form his players of the decision until he
heard from Bloom that he had no other
option and no chance of fighting for the
job. Bloom's response was to wait until
those involved could discuss the issue further and a meeting for Tuesday evening was
scheduled. Since the team had assembled
to hear Miran's announcement he "winged
it" and brought up the issue of whether or
not to allow the seven players who quit the
team in the middle of the season to return
next year. At Tuesday's meeting, Miran
was informed that the decision was final
and the only issue to discuss was how to
proceed in a manner that would be most
beneficial to Miran, the College, and the
future of the football program.
Bloom describes the background which
necessitated a decision about how to remedy the bleak outlook of the football program as an "evolving process." He explains
that widespread consulting of the Board of
Managers, faculty, students, and administration preceded the decision to ask Miran
to step down from his position of coach
and he contends that there is no change in

Miran's relationship to the College since
he has been granted a sabbatical leave and
retains his teaching position as an associate professor of physical education.
As the season came to a close, a number
of players approached Athletic Director,
Bob Williams, about their consideration of
not returning to the game next season if
Miran remained in his position as head
coach. In addition, when the seven players left the team in mid-October, some revealed to Williams that Miran and his
coaching style were their primary reason
for leaving. Williams admits that the players' dissatisfaction with Miran was part of
the decision, although not the primary reason, and states that one "can't rule out the
impact of players not continuing with the

program."

serving as assistant coach at Middlebury
and Lehigh, as assistant and later head
coach at the University School in Cleveland, and as offensive coordinator at

station house for use in emergency situations.
The vote came after an extensive discussion of
the issue of increased firepower in Swarthmore. The
initial proposal put forth by the police department
early in the summer sought the purchase of two
rifles, one for each of the borough's two marked
police cruisers. With a council vote of 4-3, this proposal did not pass and the compromise of buying
one gun for the station house was suggested early
in September. This compromise eventually passed
with a council vote of 6-1.
Although few believe that the rifle will ever be
used, many see its purchase as an important precautionary step for the borough police. According
to Chief of Police Donald Lee, Swarthmore's police force is one of few in Delaware County that
relies solely on handguns. Until 1991 each of the
police cruisers in Swarthmore was in fact equipped
with a shotgun, but these guns were removed by
Lee largely because of their inaccuracy at long
ranges. "Police officers are responsible for every
slug fired, no matter where they go," said Lee. "[As
opposed to a shotgun] a rifle shoots only one slug
at a time, so there is a much smaller margin of er-

ror."
But given the relatively low level of violence in

In a survey conducted by The Phoenix earlier during the semester, students
were asked a broad range of questions
regarding various aspects of the dining
service.
Students were particularly concerned
with long lines at Tarble, though only
5% felt the snack bar's hours should be
extended. Nearly a third of students said
they eat at least one meal a day at Tarble.
Linda McDougall, Director of Food
Services, acknowledges Tarble's space
limitations and notes that "the snack bar
was originally meant to be an alternative for students who occasionally miss
a meal. It was not designed to be a replacement for the dining hall. It has
become too popular." Long lines are
the norm at Tarble during the hours
when student credit can be used there.
The hours of operation for both Tarble
and Sharpies are quite liberal relative
to other colleges, according to
McDougall. Between both dining facilities, students can eat almost anytime
between 7:30 a.m. and 10:00 p.m.
Tarble, however, is closed to students
between 11:00 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. so
college staff can buy lunch in a timely
fashion and find a place to sit.
McDougall also points to bag lunches
as an additional alternative for students
with little time for lunch.
Beyond space problems, some students expressed concern over the lim-

ited number of meal plans the college
offers. McDougall, however, notes that
"given the small size of the student body,
adding more meal plans would create
financial burdens." According to the
survey, only three in five students eat
three meals a day on campus using a
meal card.
One reason for the fiscal limitations
of dining services results from the common student practice of taking trays,
plates, cups, and other items from
Sharpies. Sixteen-percent of students in
the survey admitted to taking non-food
items from Sharpies or Tarble.
McDougall, though, suspects the practice may be more widespread. "This is
by far the worst year in terms of students
taking things from the dining hall. We

would be happy to stock dorm kitchens
with what students need, but we have
no money for that. Every week we are
reordering supplies and that means less
money will be available for food," she
says.
Almost half of survey students said
they take food from Sharpies, with fruit,
salad items, and bagels being most popular. According to Food Services policy,
"any food taken out of the dining hall is
prohibited." But this rule is rarely, if
ever, enforced.
In terms of food quality, student reviews are mixed. Tarble rates significantly higher than Sharpies, according
to the survey. However, half of the students nonetheless feel the quality of

stances," said Wendy Emrich, the sole council member to vote against the compromise. "But the number of times it will be needed [in Swarthmore] is
extremely small... It's not thatARIS rifles are never
needed, but we should keep the number of weapons [in Swarthmore] limited."
Opponents of the rifle have cited the existence of
a Delaware County emergency response team that
can be called in to assist Borough Police in a crisis
situation, thus eliminating the need forSwarthmore
to have its own highpower weapons. However, because the members of this team have to travel in
from all over the area, it can sometimes take up to
an hour to assemble the entire squad on the scene.
While police realize that it would also take time
to go to the Swarthmore station to retrieve the rifle,
the assumption is that it would ultimately be faster
than waiting for the response team. The rifle could
then be used "to keep things safe" until help arrived, said Lee.
But Emrich and others remain unconvinced. "Negotiation should be first," she said, arguing that by
the time the police have begun mediation, "at least
some members of the response team will have arrived."
Closer to campus, one circulating story claims
that the gun was purchased in preparation for the
possibility of a sniper climbing Clothier Tower and
taking shots at people below. Professor ofEconomics and lame duck council member Mark Kuperberg
verifies this story, but believes that a more likely
scenario would involve some sort of sniper or hossee GUNS, AS

On Sunday, November 23rd,
the Student Activities Committee
finally submitted a set of procedures and guidelines governing
its operation to Student Council,
ending a drawn-out dispute which
almost resulted in a fall-out between the two parties. The latter
approved of the draft.
This marks the conclusion to a
prolonged argument which has
seen SC co-chair Ari Plost '9B
threatening to take action against

BC on the grounds of "insubordination."
SC first asked SAC to draft procedures in light of complaints
about the potential arbitrariness of
the decision-making process of
SAC given the absence of a set of
specific rules deciding the allocation offunds. Concerns also arose
about its clandestine nature; all
SAC meetings were closed prior
to the drafting of the current proposals.
However, when SC first resolved to appoint a joint work

group, which would include four
member of SAC, to draft a set of
proposals, it met the vehement
opposition of Joseph Armah '9B,
who, despite acknowledging the
need for a protocol, felt that the
rules should be drafted by SAC
alone. When SAC failed to appoint members to the committee,
SC co-chair Plost urged SAC to
draft a set ofrules soon and threatened that if it failed to do so, "such
actions would be treated as insubordination and appropriate measures will be taken." Later on,

SAC, during a closed meeting,
which was observed by a SC
member—whose presence was
only condoned after Plost threatened to discount the meeting altogether—decided to hold a retreat to draft the guidelines. Yet
after the meeting it was reported
to SC that the decision to hold a
retreat was not a consensual one.
SC decided to call an emergency
issue to clarify the issue. At the
meeting, SC members were reassured by both Armah and other
SAC members that the decision

had been unanimous. Nonetheless, some SC members took the
opportunity to reassert their claim
that SC has a legitimate claim to
talcing part in the drafting process
as well.
In the end, after several rounds
of heated debate, it was decided
that SAC would stick to its original plan and that it would submit
a timetable on November 9th, proceeded by a full proposal on November 23rd.

decided to rehead
lieve
football coach
Karl Miran ofhis duties. The decision reflects an ongoing tension between the College's desire to maintain high academic standards and
to provide a positive extra-curricular experience for its students.
S warthmore, believe it or not, was
a football powerhouse at the turn
of the century, that is, until the Honors system was instituted and the
athletics program suffered as a result. At this point the administration
decided to change the fundamental
character of the College to take a
more academic-oriented slant. Since
then, certain athletic teams have
shown flashes of brilliance, but overall, the record has been mediocre.
Not surprisingly, Swarthmore these
days is best known as a heavy-duty
intellectual training ground.
Granted, our primary purpose at
the College is to gain academic
knowledge, but is there anything
else to it?
A recent edition of the mission
statement of the College reads,
"Swarthmore students are expected
to prepare themselves for full, balanced lives as individuals and citizens thorough exacting intellectual
study supplemented by a varied
program of sports and other extracurricular activities."
However, not just any sports program will do. The whole purpose

much lesser degree at Swarthmore

one.
The College's decision to expunge Miran seems to imply that
the administration does value the
importance of winning...but winning too much might not be a good
idea. Rumor has it that the last football coach was fired because he
won too many games. Regardless
of whether this is true, it appears
evident that the College does feel
pressure to uphold its reputation as
an academic, not athletic powerhouse, as Coach Miran pointed out,
and an oversuccessful athletic program directly threatens that very

image.
But are a competitive academic
program and athletic program mutually exclusive? We don't believe
so. A recent letter sent to the paper
by an alumnus suggested that the
football team be disbanded altogether. We don't think that's the
appropriate solution. Yes, perhaps
athletics should play a secondary
role but that does not mean it

shouldn't be a constructive role.
It's a tough balancing act, without
doubt, but giving up either side is
not the solution. There's no easy
way out, and whatever resolution
arises in the end will be the result
of good faith on the part of all parties involved and a mutual commitment to better the Swarthmore experience for all.

A way to save the football program
To the Editors:
The Swarthmore football crisis,
which started with ourembarrasing
losing streak, festered with the
quitting of seven players, and
peaked with the forced resignation
ofcoach Karl Miran, deserves some
serious attention. Besides these ills,
the football program is marred with
even more problems: lack of motivation, lack of student interest, expense, and recruiting problems. At
times, the football program-seems
to be maintained merely because of
alumni pressure—a dubious reason
to sustain an expensive and somewhat unpopular program. Although
I am neither a football player nor a
fan, I understandthe benefit offootball at Swarthmore: it is communal,
fun, traditional: a good tussle.
A possible solution would be the
reconsideration of the organization
of football at Swarthmore. Instead
of participating in the Division 111

games, the College could restrucit an intramural or club program, like ultimate frisbee. If interest sustained itself, multiple teams could be
formed, touch, flag, and tackle
could be tried, more students could
participate, both men and women
would be eligible to play, money
would be saved, recruiting would be
and

unnecessary,
spectatorship would likely increase.
Football might even become cool
again, as ultimate frisbee has become under such a model. The
hunky uniforms could be maintained and the game could be made
more fun and hip—less regimented
and arch-traditional. The football
program would be maintained but
modified: alumni support might
even be sustained. Plus: there would

However, the price of this success was steep: administrationand
faculty officials, unnerved by the
unprecedented press coverage and
apprehensive about theeffect a successful program might have on its
academic reputation, rewarded
Lapinski with early retirement. The
team, to my knowledge, hasn't had
a winning season since.
When school officials finally
recognize that a top-notch football
program and a top-rated English
department are not mutually exclusive, Swarthmore football
teams may yet again find the will
and the means to compete.
Until then, they are destined to
break the school's infamous

streak, ironically, which came to
and end under Tom Lapinski in

Swarthmore offers so many different organizations for people to become a part of. The Conscious
Consumers and their self-defeating nature however, are the one
group on campus that I truly wish
would disband and never be heard
from again.
What I am getting at here is that
we already pay a LOT of money

doing anything to help us out.

to hurt the students at Swarthmore
than to improve the social fabric.

I commend the school for making the correct decision in divesting from South Africa during
apartheid. But for the most part,
whether we like it or not,
Swarthmore is a business and
must operate as such.
I am part of a very large percentage of students who are on
finacial aid and forcing
Swarthmore to divest is not going to help any of us. I for one
would much rather let Philip Morris make their money (and I am
no fan of the tobacco industry)
and earn a very good education
than be forced to take time off or
go even further into debt because
I simply can't afford the tuition
hike that divestment would result
in. My suggestion to the Conscious Consumers is step down

from the moral highground, just
until you graduate. At that point,
use your thorough and wellsudsidized education to go after
whomever you choose. In the
meantime, let therest offinish our
time at Swarthmore with at least
some hope of paying off our loans
before we start collecting our pensions which I'm sure will be based
on questionable invesments too.

It begins with Professor Vera

term paper which he had written
for Professor Lisa Hajjar's Sociology/Anthropology 71 class. Although Professor Hajjar had given
Assad the highest possible grade
for his paper (an A+), Professor
Moreen thought otherwise and
wrote a devastating personal note
to Assad opening with a list of
disparaging adjectives that his
paper was so much trash.
Professor Moreen went on,
against all academic ethics and

to him or her comments in class.
This "professor" left Assad (a

right for Professor Hajjar could be

so wrong for Professor Moreen.
When Assad complained to the

know that taking pride in your emotional
and physical safety after a traumatic incident is much more difficult than passing a
math test. Math tests are self-inflicted,
while survivors have theirbattles forced on
them by someone else, and the price of their
failure is their life and/or emotional stability. Anonymous tells of an event which
happened to her, and outlines things that
her friends have told her. Earlier this year,
the man she was dating came over early in
the morning and asked her to have sex with
him. She said no several times, and knew
that it wasn't what she wanted, but they
had sex anyway. She enjoyed it. She
doesn't feel that she is a survivor. "I'm sure
that depending on who you talk [to], it is a
classic date rape scenario or simply a bad

it just had to happen." It is the participant's/
survivor's/victim's right to say that something wasn't rape if that's the way she feels.
No one can make you a survivor if you
don't believe that you are one. Reading her
story, I found myself not only appalled at
what happened, but also aghast that a modern Swatties could believe that such a thing
"just had to happen".
Violation of trust and/or a person's body
can hurt a person physically and emotionally. I hope that Swarthmore has not slipped
back to thelaissez-faire attitude where violations of laws, societal custom, and personal respect just "has to happen". It
doesn't have to happen, but it does, even here
in our little Utopia. We just don't talk about
it, because here we're all enlightened, sensitive, assertive people. To admit that rape happens here, and to admit that while nothing is
ever black and white, violation is violation...
admitting those two things would personalize rape— to erase the "me" and "not-possi-

Anonymous suggests that 90% of "rapes"
are symptoms of a culture that "glorifies
the myth of victimization". If victimization
is a myth and if rape is glorified, then perhaps she is right. However, as another possibility, I'm suggesting that her article exhibits well what those rapes are a symptom of. They are a symptom of a culture
where a woman's words are not enough,
of a culture that claims that there is something ambiguous about the word "no", and
where people accept things that they don't
want to think about (or that they don't have
answers to) as having to happen, They are
symptoms of a society that is confused by
a woman who is upset that her wishes and

of our culture's judgments. The survivors of

I learned through these trials and

you are without this knowledge.
Participation on a team sport is first
and foremost a giving experience.
If your goal is solely personal satisfaction and development, you will
fail as a member. Your coach will

responsibility for your own actions.

and called upon my ability to separate my own needs from the goal

taken away from this team.
Karl had earned your unfailing
support just as my coach had at
Bates. His longstanding demand for
excellence from himself and his
teams since the 1970s has earned
him the respect of many professional and personal peers, and they
have shown him a lifetime of support when you failed him and for
that I am grateful.
Karl set an example for this team
that has not even begun to sink in.
Their fortitude and grace under the
very hardest of circumstances is a
quality they will call upon over and
over again in their adult life. It is
not a lesson that is easy to learn nor
one we consciously set out to teach
but they will know that later on in
adulthood when they have the maturity and hindsight to judge this
season and Karl's perfomance more
honestly. You, however, have not
been so honest, and Swarthmore's
decades of pride in lost football
games should not fall solely in
Karl's lap. You did not come
through for this program and for all
the men's programs that continue
to struggle for any number of reasons. For that reason alone, I find
your dismissal of Karl small college polititics at its worst and a
complete lack of understanding
about the nature of sports.

Head coach let go

Borough gives Swat

Swarthmore, compiled a 25-51 -1 record in his eight
seasons at Swarthmore. The Garnett Tide had a

winning 7-3 record in his first season and finished
second in the Centennial Conference in 1992.
Starting linebacker, Tucker Zengerle 'OO, supports
the College's decision to replace Miran and credits
Miran's strong beginning at Swarthmore to the fact
that he did not recruit the players on his earliest
Swarthmore teams. "One thing that Coach Miran
said last year after we went 0-10 that has bothered
me ever since is that now we're going to do everything we can to get new kids here [through more
aggressive recruiting]. What was he doing before

tage situation in a house with police
taking action from across the street.
Even after the compromise, residentreaction to the purchase of the
gun has been very mixed and very
heated. The Swarthmorean, the
weekly borough newspaper, has received scores of letters from citizens both for and against the gun.
The Religious Society ofFriends issued a public statement expressing
concern that by voting to purchase
the rifle the community was abandoning its peaceful Quaker values.
Others have said they would not feel
any safer in a borough thathas a rifle,
but might in fact feel somewhat less
safe knowing that such a weapon was
so readily available for use.
Those who voted in favor of the
gun are trying to reassure citizens
that the rifle will only be used as a
last resort. According to the October 17, 1997 issue of The
Swarthmorean, borough Mayor
Guy Smith is confident that the pursuit of peaceful solutions to problems will continue to be paramount,
and that the new rifle will not lead
to a use of excessive force.

finding."
Players' dissatisfaction with Miran includes a
number of qualms. Pat Straub '97, a player for the
Garnett Tide who witnessed the first year of the losing streak during his senior year, cites Miran's relationship with the players and the "way he managed people" as primary reasons that led to a loss
of support from many players. Zengerle admits, "I
didn't feel much of a connection with him. He
didn't work us hard enough in practice and I al-

,

ways had to motivate myself."
Straub, like most players interviewed, believes it
is unfair to place all the blame on Miran for the
team's losing streak, but remembers that when he
saw teammates he counted on last year quitting, he
"knew the program was crumbling." Quarterback
J.P. Harris "99 agrees that Miran was not fully to
blame for the downward turn the program took.
"We could have the best coach in the world and not
win games," Harris explains. "Since we're the ones
playing, we have to take the responsibility." Wide
receiver and kick returner, Mason Tootle "99, also
believes Miran has fallen into the role of scapegoat
for many of the team's problems. "I'm not sure
that the firing is going to change our problems,"
Tootle admits, "but the truth is that people are excited about next season and people haven't been
excited for a while."
In looking for a replacement for Miran, Bloom
believes that "having somebody with already developed, strong connections to the high schools from
which werecruit and having someone like Karl who
is committed to the joining ofexcellence in the academic program and excellence in sports will help
the college...to secure the future of the [football]
program." Bloom emphasizes that it is essential
that a new coach deeply understands the priority
the Swarthmore community places on academics,
but Bloom also recognizes the central role a coach
must play in "sustaining players' interest in the game
and enabling them to draw maximum satisfaction
from it."
The process to hire a new head coach will begin
immediately under the direction of Williams and
Provost, Jennie Keith. An advertisement for the
position will be released early next week and by
the time students are back from break in mid-January Williams hopes to screen and consider some
finalists for the position. He emphasizes that the
input of players will be of utmost importance in
selecting a new coach.
Miran stresses that if he had be given a choice in
the matter, he would have remained at Swarthmore.
He cites the "hypocrisy" of "a college that hasn't
given a darn about the number of kids in the football program for many years from the Board of
Managers down putting me in this situation to begin with." He disagrees with the decision on the
grounds that it is not what is best for any parties
involved including the Swarthmore football program. He criticizes the College for not taking
needed measures five years ago to prevent the
present circumstances which, Miran claims, he did
not create. Miran sees the act of taking steps now
to improve the program as merely "picking up the
pieces." He blames the fact that he has lost the support of many of his players on the team's losing
streak. "Those who are pointing fingers now
wouldn't be doing so if we were winning," Miran
believes. "I'm the same coach I was the first six
years I was here."
Miran believes manyof his team's problems were
a product of the intellectually-based environment
of the Swarthmore community. He feels strongly
that a new coach, regardless of his or her level of
enthusiasm and dedication, will accomplish little if
jnet with the same low level of support from the
College under which Miran worked. In comparing
Swarthmore to the other small, academically-prestigious colleges at which he has worked in the past
(Middlebury and Amherst), Miran notes many distinctions and credits them with making Swarthmore
the "best intellectual experience a student could
have." At the same time, however, he believes that
Swarthmore is not seen by the public as the best
institution for a student to lead a well-balanced life
in which academics are one of many components.
According to Miran, it is because of this image that
the College seeks to foster that support for the athletic program is lacking and that the football program has reached a low point.
Bloom assures that the College will establish a
renewed commitment to athletics through a more
aggressive recruiting process. He responds to
Miran's allegation that the Swarthmore community
s a challenging environment in which to generate
for team sports by saying, "I think we can
all do better to support athletics at the College in
recruiting, in appreciating the energy and skills our
students devote, and in sharing in the excitement
of their accomplishments and we will." He plans
attract athletes to the College by offering them a
"pretty attractive package" which includes the opportunity for playing time coupled with the finest
academic education in the world.
Neil Austrian '6l, member of the Board of Mansince 1979 and president and Chief Operating Officer of the National Football League since
•991, sees the College's decision as a "wake-up call
lowing us that we can't ignore the other side of a

Chief Lee argues that police officers simply never know what
might happen from day to day, and
while Kuperberg concedes that "the
danger [in Swarthmore] can be exaggerated," he believes that there's
only so far borough residents can go
intelling the police what to do. "(The
police] are the actual ones out there,
the ones who are directly responsible
for what happens in a given situation." Emrich, however, does not
agree. "We had plenty of information to make the decision," she said.
The ongoing saga of the
Swarthmore rifle has attracted the
attention of media outlets all over
the Delaware Valley. Aside from
making primetime local news headlines, Philadelphia Magazine is
currently preparing an in-depth article on the story. Kuperberg believes that it's not the gun itself that
interests people, but rather the debate that's surrounded the issue.
"The mayor actually has the authority to go ahead and buy the guns
without the permission of the town,
but he wanted the council to decide
because he knew there would be
differences of opinion... I think
that's a unique Swarthmore thing."

New, comprehensive
SAC proceedures OK'd
from RULZ.AI
detail how future SAC meetings
would be carried out —providing
that the first half-hour of every
meeting be open to the public—and
hammered out very specific criteria
used to consider funding proposals.
The guidelines basically adhere to
time-honored SAC principles that
activities should to be campus-wide
and non-profit, as well as both nonideological and non-religious. However, the rules are much more refined and specific. For example,
they point out how despite the committee would not fund political or
religious events, "all-campus parties/socials hosted by religious or
political groups will be considered."
The consensus of SC members is
that the procedure is up to par. "I
personally, and SC as a group think
that SAC did a good job,"remarked
Sarah Pheasant '9B, SC co-chair.
"The went beyond simply stating
the procedures."
SAC is also satisfied with the final outcome. "I think we did a good
job in coming up with really good
guidelines," said Armah, "I'm pretty

satisfied with that." "And if the
committee is going to follow these
procedures most arbitrariness associated with the committee will be
eliminated."
Armah also feels that the new
rules give the committee sufficient
accountability, and in response to
calls for more transparency within
SAC, he expressed concern about
how the volume of student input
would threaten the autonomy of

SAC members, pointing out how
the second-halfof the meeting was

allocated for the specific purpose
for planning SAC events. "Now
that [SAC meetings] it is open for
the first half-hour, if people have
problems on how money is allocated they can bring it up," said
Armah. Yet, he felt that opening the
entire meeting to the public would
undermine the work ofSAC members. "Members ofSAC are specifically appointed by SC to throw allcampus events," said Armah,
"what's the point of having people
[in the second half of the meeting]?" "If they have ideas they can
run them by SAC members."

Swatties speak out on meal plan, Sharpies and Tarble
from FOOD, AI
Tarble's food could be improved, while 75% feel this
way about Sharpies food.
The lack of enthusiasm
about the food quality contributes to a significant
amount of wasted food. In
the past, Food Services has
noted that "waste adversely
affects all of us in the terms
of quality offood that can be
provided and the cost to you
of that food. Most of all, it's
time for all of us to be aware
of the world's limited resources and do our best to
preserve them."
Still, over 60% of students
surveyed said they waste at
least "some" food each meal.
A third said they waste at
least a half of what they take.
McDougall says that having compared the college's
food to that of many other

colleges and universities,
Swarthmore's food quality is
"much better than average. I
think we do a really good job
here, although there is always
room for improvement," she
says.
McDougall occasionally
gets recipes from students and
is always looking for new
ideas, particularly for the vegetarian selection.
"If you have an issue with
the food or anything about
food services in general, talk

Influential poet

By Liz Cho
une Jordan, a professor of Af
rican-American Studies at the
of California-Ber
keley, visited the Swarthmore
m College campus this week to
£
read her work and to discuss
M
Berkeley's "Poetry for the
People" program that she has developed
and directs. She has published 24 books
that include poems, novels, plays, essays,
and non-fiction for children. Ms. Jordan
is also a regular columnist for 'The Progressive" and is a political and social activist. She has been honored for her work
with the Nora Astorga Award from
Madre, an advocacy organization for
U.S.-Latin American women.
In an interview at the Swarthmore
Black Cultural Center on Monday, December 1 st, Ms. Jordan was friendly and
thoughtful. With smooth skin that is a
medium shade of brown and short curly
hair, she looks younger than her 61 years.
Ms. Jordan has survived an abusive childhood home, racism, and poverty. In spite
of that, she laughs often and speaks of
life and politics with hope as well as anger.
Liz: What does the writing of poems
mean to you?
June: Well, I'm a poet so it means I'm
alive. Writing poetry means I'm alive;
I'm a poet, that's what I am.
Liz: Is that how you define yourself?
June: Yes, actually, I am a poet. I'm a
poet in the world from the time I was very,
very little and thinking about who am I
or what am I and the only thing that was
obvious to me was that I am a poet....And
that was comforting to me, to be able to
say to myself who I am or what I am, in a
relatively short sentence [laughing].

Mortal Kombat:

taken over the box office just like its predecessor, beating both the highly-touted
Anastasia and Francis Ford Coppola's
long-awaited Grisham adaptation The
Rainmaker.
1995's original Mortal Kombat was a
surprise hit, as movies based on video
games have understandably low expectations-—witness Street Fighter. Mortal
Kombat, however, was different. It distilled the features of both the comic book
action flick and the kung fu movie (especially Enter The Dragon) and re-packaged
them in a fast-moving, music-filled, visually-interesting romp that had kids (and
me) in the theater over and over again.
A sequel was inevitable, and now, a little
over two years later, we have Mortal
Kombat: Annihilation, which is basically
Mortal Kombat cubed. It takes the concept of the original, throws plotting and
characterization out the window (as if the
original had much of that anyway), multiplies the number and complexity of the
fight sequences by about 3, and turns the
volume of the techno music up 5 notches.

"It's a mysterious process, the acquisition of
voice, but I know as a poet I think it follows from
years and years of questing after utmost accu-

make in trying to say anything whatsoever."

June: Oh, because I was so absolutely
infatuated with language and preoccupied
with words and writing poetry from so
early on. I started reading when I was really, really young and writing when I was
very young and so forth and quite soon
the kind of reading I preferred was poetry and definitely the kind of writing I
preferred, and not only preferred, but
wanted to pursue and get better all the
time was poetry.
Liz: How did you develop your own
style?
June: Well, I don't think that anybody
ever knows how to find his or her own
voice. I think a voice is something that
emerges in the work of a writer or a poet
and in part it's a mysterious process, the
acquisition of voice, but I know as a poet
I think it follows from years and years of
questing after utmost accuracy and the
use of the choice of words that you make

Because that accuracy—when you say
accurate, in what way? accurate to

styles, each performed with an

exuberance bound
to delight any audience.
The opening act,
entitled "The ProDance Beat
gram is Morally
Good," combines
folk dance forms with those we would
usually expect from "modern dance." This
contrast gives choreographer Ayla Yavin
a chance to play with a distinctionbetween
"high" and "folk" culture in the interaction between girls in dresses and boyish
characters clothed in overalls. The dance
takes on a more serious tone when the
soundtrack changes to a song about death.
At this point, Yavin hobbles across the
stage, bent at the waist. Despite its initial
seriousness, this section has a joyous resolution as the character takes victory in life
and strength.
There is also joy in Rachel Brooker's
piece, "Water Cadenza," a solo piece in
which Brooker experiments with the different levels in which she can move. Accompanied by a techno music background
written by Martin Carrillo, Brooker combines grace and bold movement to create
a remarkable flow. The remarkable contrasts in level and speed twirl together into
a unified piece that expresses a quiet joy.
The next piece, choreographed by
Sharon Friedler and Sally Hess, is a section from the opera "Dido and Aeneas."

Insidious Bell Tower

Dance

show

causes campus stress

from DANCE, BI

By James Wing

Swarthmore

is stressful; it's an undeniable fact.
The administration is quite aware of it and has
taken steps from implementing academic sup
ports to providing funds for various social
activities in order to curb tensions. But they still
haven't addressed the root of the problem. It's the
bell tower.
Yes, the bell tower is the true cause of stress on campus. It seems innocuous; it can almost be ignored.
We have grown accustomed to hearing it from the start
of the day to late into the night. But the bell, four
times an hour, tears into the sanity of every student on

campus.
This is a death knell, folks. Ingrained into our collective consciousness, doom is associated with this
chime. In Macßeth, it sends Duncan to Hell. Do we
really need a death knell four times a day? We are
dying quite well without this extra help, thank you
very much.
And where are the most famous bell towers in the
world? Russia. Not only does the chime delinetate
death, but reminds us of the oppression of communism. Is it any wonder that Swatties often view their
classwork as yet another form of this oppression?
It gets worse. The notes of the bell tower are B G A
and D. If you hear these notes together, it sounds awful,
dissonant, and tense. You can stand directly under
Clothier and experience the same effect from these
resonating instruments of torture. This underlying tension festers in our psychies, but is hidden under the

trope of an innocent little melody. Insidious, eh?
One student suggested that this tension symbolized
the human fear of time, for we cannot control it. Everybody has already discovered that there isn't enough
time; do we need this fact rubbed in our faces some 48
times a day?
Oh yes, you can try and blame stress on Sharpies
food. But it's hardly surprising that these people can't
prepare a decent meal under these disturbing circumstances. Shouldn't the professors be equally affected
and thus be more lenient on students? They only hear
the bell the few hours that they are on campus, and
since they are lecturing most of that time, they hardly
take notice.
I think immediateaction is necessary to alleviate this
source of discontent. I propose that we change the
melody of the bell to something more upbeat. How
about It's a small world after all! Envision the sweeping changes that this modification would accompany:
Swatties always greeting each other on the pathways;
cheerful students, happily skipping to organic chem
lab in eager anticipation. Or perhaps We are the world:
The college dems would lighten up, and hateful
chalkings would be a thing of the past.
Such changes would put us on the cusp of realising
the Utopian environment that Swarthmore is supposed
to be. Right?
James Wing is quite stressed, as he has heard the
bell tower at least four times during the course ofpreparing this article.

Sig's Shindig Review
Friday arid Saturday nights are only distant
memories. But we as a party-going population should not be so quick to forget what drives
ms to fight our way through a week of toil and
trouble: the priceless hours of ten till two.
When the week is through it is not the basement of McCabe or the Paces date that we talk
about, but instead those crazy stories of SACfunded splendor that guide us as we romp
through the night. And what is it that makes a
great party? It is the feeling one gets when
they leave the party only because the PA's want
to go home. The feeling you get when you
finally realize that the only people left at the
party are sweeping around yon, but you have
been having too much fun to notice.

To wrap up the semester in one outburst of words
seems trite, fee there are mingstfiat have been forgotten over the course of the semester. So here is a brief
overview ofjust what we saw this semester.
We saw Upper Tarble both empty and packed, a
million bands on the Oide Club stage, BMCs lining the walls of the party venues, the swimmers
in speedos, Paces at about a hundred and twenty
degrees, the free show from the women ofrugby,
the guy who always dances on the bar at Paces,
some guy in a shopping cart at ML, another passed
out on the side of the road, and most of all the

hordes of dancing fools who populate the beersoaked floors during our sacred time,
Now it is time to announce the Party of the Semester. To be fair to the many organizations that
hosted the parties this semester, there were three
parties which ranked as the best. The first was

It changes emotions dramatically as
the famous tale progresses. The
piece begins with a duet between
Dido and Aeneas, as Belinda and
two other servants emphasize
Dido's sorrow in the background,
through repetitive movement. This
is followed by a duet between Dido
and Belinda that provides a moment of quietude before the joyful
moments of skipping and pursuing
love's conquest that follow. After
this exuberance, the wicked sorceress enters, calling upon her witch
compatriots. Following her solo is
the witches' extremely humorous
dance. The piece as a whole is very
theatrical, engaging the audience
with facial expressions and exaggerated movement.
After the intermission, the pieces
are more varied, yet continue to
express the joy that exists throughout this concert. The first piece is
a flamenco piece entitled "One,"
choreographed by Amity Cox and
Susan Novak. Those who have not
been exposed to flamenco before
will be astounded by the combination of sudden and slow movement
in this form ofdance and the drama
conveyed in each movement.
The next piece combines dance
and drama in a piece that cannot be
described, since it is different at
every performance. This is a piece
called "Sloooowly I ended before I
was ready," and it is performed

without music by the Improvisation

who were able to pack Upper Tarble and get
the campus all dressed up. The second was
"lost in Space," by far the most decorated of
all parties, hosted by the Men's soccer team.
The third of this triumph is the Halloween
party, which also got the campus dressed up.
Congratulations to all of the organizations who
threw these excellent parties. And for the entire campus I would like to thank all of those
organizations, SAC, the DJ's, the bartds, the
bartenders, the dancers, the drunks, and anyone else that makes the time between ten and

Movement, energy, and creativity

The tap piece that follows, called
"Winter Rhythms

abstract quality of the improvisation. Choreographed by members
of the Tap Class under the direction of LaDeva Davis and Darrell
Williams, this piece is just what you
would expect from tap

music to accompany this piece. Instead, the feet do the talking.
Although all of these pieces were
incredibly joyful in their own ways,
none can top the fun of the concert's

final piece, "Pass the Peas." Performed and choreographed by Jen
Slaw and Dave Bosworth, this combination of dance and juggling is a
delight to watch. The fun that Slaw
and Bosworth have comes across
clearly, accented by their humorous
costumes, and the audience cannot
help enjoying it.

June Jordan poems ring of honesty and love
from JORDAN, BI
vealed per se.
Liz: In your poem, "Free Flight," from
the book, haruko/love poems, you ended
with the lines:
"maybe I just need to love myself myself and
anyway
I'm working on it"
and I thought that was really interesting
because I think self-love is such a difficult
thing to accomplish. Have you reached the
point where you love yourself?
June: I'm still working on it. I agree
with you, it's very, very difficult. I don't
have the answers about how you speed that
process up. [Laughs]. Or how you finally
achieve a steady state of self-love but I do
really believe that it's the touchstone for
your ability to love other people —for example, to make healthy connections with
other folks you have to love yourself first.
I think it's exceedingly difficult; I think
most of us fail at that—not all the time of
course, but again and again. And again and
again try to succeed for however long it
is—half an hour, a whole afternoon, one
entire love affair, half a love affair—you
know, whatever you can get you should go
forand just be conscious that's partly what
you're chasing after and that it's a profound
and seriously legitimate goal.
Liz: How do you think political activism and poetry are related?
June: I think poetry in and ofitself is an
act of political activism because I think of
poetry as the medium for telling the truth
and I think that anybody telling the truth
in our body politic right now is making a
political statement. And telling the truth is
kind of related, in difficulty,
to what we were talking about earlier—loving one's self—it's very hard to do. It's
very hard to tell the truth...for example, to
tell the truth to one's self, let alone to turn
around and try to tell that to other people.
It's very, very difficult, but I think that the
job, the obligation of the poet, is to make
that effort tirelessly and therefore that's a
political act.
Liz: I was thinking about that because if
a lot of your poetry stems from your own
experience, it's like you're telling your
most personal story to the whole world. I
was wondering how you do that and what

it's like when you see your work out in print
and you know that anybody, and everybody,
can read it.
June: Well, I think that—this is in respect to the political nature of poetry, as I
see it—in order to do that, there's some
assumptions you have to make. One is that
other people are to some important extent
trustworthy with yourself—because you're
putting yourself in other people's hands,
literally, in a way. Now, that's a political
call. But you have to be willing to do that
if you're gonna tell the truth and write poetry on that basis. And I think another aspect of the political meaning of this is you
have to believe that other people are worth
the effort of trying to talk with them—that
they are really worth that effort that you're
making to say what that is from your heart
and your head as precisely and as powerfully as you can. I wouldn't say that everybody shares my political point of view
on this, or my artistic point of view on this
at all, but this is my point of view, absolutely. And I harbor these views and I try
to honor them in a completely conscious
way. So it's high risk, absolutely high risk.
But, for myself, if I'm not doing something
high risk, I'm bored.
Liz: I scanned through a paperback book
about your "Poetry for the People" program
at Berkely, and I was hoping you could tell
me about that. I thought the book was so
exciting because I grew up with the white
male poets, too, and I had never read a book
of poetry that was full of such—it seemed
very raw to me —I had never read a group
of poems like that.
June: It's called Poetry for the People
because it's not poetry for the poets or poetry for the published, it's poetry for the
people. The idea is that by the people, we
mean everybody and anybody who wants
to try and learn how to express himself or
herself with words, according to some imperative dictate coming from his or her
heart...that's nothing trifling or optional.
That person is trying to say something that
they're entirely serious about and passionate about. That means, necessarily, that
some of the people writing in "Poetry of
the People" will perhaps never become
what some of us might regard as really
good poets, quote unquote, whatever that
means. But, in the context of the program,
"Poetry for the People," that's not a possi-

bility because we believe that if anybody
really, really follows the guidelines for
"Poetry for the People" and really, really
tries to say whatever he or she feels as absolutely truthfully as possible then that in
itself—the really good poem, the really not
good poem, those considerations become
irrelevant—because there's something else
happening. Somebody is trying to tell how
he feels or wants or how he thinks about
himself in the world and taking that risk
and that's something I find irresistably
compelling. So that's why some of the
poetry might be what you call raw.
Liz: But I like it. When I say raw, I don't
mean anything negative at all. I just mean
it has a vibrancy to it.
June: Rather unpolished. There's no
time, they're just trying to say what they
feel or want as quickly as possible, to get
it out here.
Liz: It has a kind of energy to it that's
completely different when I read it.
June: Yeah, because it really is coming
from what I call this interior imperative,
which is very different from somebody
getting up and stretching and yawning and
saying, "Oh, I wonder what I'm gonna
write aobut today." [Laughing]. Different.
Liz: You said, "As a black poet and
writer, I am proud of our Black, verbally
bonding system born of our struggle to
avoid annihilation." What is your reaction
to the idea of Ebonics being taught in
schools?
June: This is a little complicated. I'm
on record, ages ago, thirty some years ago,
talking on behalf of and writing in Black
English, so this is ridiculous to me that
there's still an argument agout this. I'm
like, hello? I wrote the first novel ever
published in this country that's entirely
written in black English, almost thirty years
ago. I think the word Ebonics is really unfortunate and I hate the word. I think a lot
of the things that were said on behalf of
Ebonics, as it was called, were really unfortunate and ignorant, like saying that
we're genetically pre-disposed to one kind
of language. It was like, Whoa! No. The
Ebonics controversy, unfortunately almost
obscured, is the issue of the political meaning of language in the United States of
America. We live in a multi-lingual world
but also in this country, more and more
people are not native speakers of Standard

English and they are citizens of the United
States. And Black children have come
through to the point where they enter the
compulsory public school education system in this country with a distinct language
system that I call Black English. That is
not a matter of opinion, that is a matter of
fact. There's an increasing number ofchildren who come from homes that do not
speak Standard English, whether it's because they speak Black English or
Cantonese or Punjabi, I don't care—it's not
Standard English. It seems to me that because language is power, you have to have
a provision within the public schools to
teach that child how to read and write in
his or her own language (I call it the home
language). Once you've done that, then
they are able to go on and learn whatever
other languages you have to offer. If what
you do instead is to alienate the child from
his or her home language by saying whatever language you're bringing in from
home is wrong, as against different, then
you're alienating children from language,
per se, and as you know, all our intelligence
tests are geared toward language abilities.
So horrible things follow from that. In other
words, I see Black English as part of this
whole issue of language and politics in this
country. What are we gonna do to honor
the home languages ofall the children who
come into our public schools with a language other than the language of Tom
Brokaw?The answers that we make to that
are gonna determine a lot—not only gonna
determine the future of the children, but
it's also gonna determine the future of this
country, okay? This country does not belong the people who are the children ofTow
Brokaw—that's not what's happening.
Check all the demographic forecasts. It's
not only on the basis of the changing color
of the emerging American majority, but it's
also the changing home language of the
emerging American majority. The home
language of the emerging American majority—including Black English—when
we get into 2010 will no longer be so-called
Standard English.
Liz: I read that you said, "the only way I
could change into somebody powerful was
this: I had to imitate the powerful people
that I saw around me." How does this idea
affect you in your work as a teacher, working with students that probably look up to

you?
June: I would say how I imitate people
who are powerful is that I try to have as
much energy as anybody I know and I try
to work all the time because I figure the
big guys, they never quit. In California,
first you had 187 then we had 209 then we
have an anti-bilingual thing coming up.
They never stop. And on the left, a lot of
times people go, "Whew, okay, that's it. We
did this...." And it's like no. [Laugh]. You
can't stop. I always feel like there's something else I need to find out or some other
fact I have to lock down. The other thing
is that I try to do enough homework and to
think about things carefully enough so that
if I do take the position I mean it. It's not
like I think, I say I know. To the best of
my ability, I know and this is what I believe. Therefore, when I come upon somebody who is really powerful and coming
from a place of convicition about whatever
he thinks, he's meeting somebody who's
equally convicted about what she believes.
I'm like, I'm not playing either. I've done
my homework, I've done my thinking, I've
done my work and I think this is right or I
think this is wrong. And I really mean it. I
mean, to the wall, I mean it. And I think

that really matters—to at least match your
opponents with passionate preparation and

integrity of determination. I think, very
often, one of the things that happens on the
left—which is really unfortunate—is that
people are very afraid to use words like
right and wrong. And people on the other
side are not afraid at all. They make moral
judgementsright and left, all the time. And
people on the progressive side, they say,
"This would be preferable. This would
seem to be desirable." I'm like, no—this is
wrong. If you can't meet somebody on that
level, I think that means somewhere along
the line, you yourself haven't taken the
question as it were to that level where you
have to make a right or wrong call about it.
And I think that if you really gonna give
your whole life to something—or give everything you've got to something—l don't
understand how you can do that unless you
take your research and outreach efforts and
best imaginings all the way to a right or
wrong place of judgement. And then having made that decision, stand on that moral
basis ofbelief. I wouldn't last without that
level of serious intent.

Book review: 'Sex and the City'
(U-WIRE) BERKELEY, Calif.

"Here's a Valentine's Day tale,"
says the opening line of Sex and
the City, "Prepare yourself." Brutally honest, this phrase is a perfect beginning to Candace
Bushnell's novel. A dishy piece of
work, Sex and the City's portrayals of New York City's "it" people
—the richest, best looking and
most successful
transcend mere
description. In fact, Bushnell cunningly reads behind her characters'
facades to offer the reader a view
of their masked discontent.
Compiled from her serial columns in the New York Observer
over the course of two years,
Bushnell's Sex and the City is
based on real-life stories that she
has fictionalized by using pseudonyms. Stylistically, she is part
soap opera and part sociological
study, with a touch of dating
manual thrown in for good measure. Sex and the City is initially
chaotic and confusing
using

pointedly abrupt sentences, choppy
characterizations, enticing chapter
titles and sweeping generalizations
but readers quickly grow accustomed to Bushnell's audacious authorship.
Staged in a world of trendy Manhattan bars, beachfront homes in the
Hamptons and countless drug addictions, Sex and the City quickly
loses its personalities amidst all the
glamour. At first glance, the lifestyle
of these career-driven animals appears shallow
centering mainly
around maintaining strict social associations. Each new chapter unravels a new piece of the ever-entangled soap opera, introducing a
new social group filled with elusive,
quirky characters.
We meet "the modelizers," a
group of independently wealthy
men.who spend all of their time,
money and contacts attempting to
seduce young and easily impressed
models (an objective easily accomplished). These suave characters

of Mortal Kombat, as some evil guy in an enormous costume (Brian Thompson) shows up and
says that the Earth will be destroyed in 6 days,
just because, and that no one can stop it, not Lord
Rayden (James Remar, taking over for Christopher Lambert), our heroLiu Kang (Robin Shou),
or his friends from the first movie, some of whom
have inexplicably changed into other actors in
the interim.
Of course, none of the good guys are going to
take the destruction of the Earth sitting down,
so they try to stop the evil lord by any and all
means. It all culminates in a battle to the death
at the end, of course, which I can only describe
with two words: Mortal Kombat!!!!!
Serieusty,-1 hada'gbod time watching Mortal
Kombat: mhihilation, and 1 think that most fans
of the first film will as well. Many reviewers
are complaining about its violence and lack of
plotting and common sense, but I can't imagine
anyone went into this movie expecting Liu Kang
of Arabia. It is exactly what it claims to be: a
90-minute video game.
John Leonetti is the director of MortalKombat:
Annihilation. He was the cinematogrpher of the
original, and his father Matthew Leonetti is the
cinematographer of this installment. The elder
Leonetti did lots of stunning work on 80's action flicks like Commando and Extreme Prejudice, and it's good that there are visual stylists
at the helm of this movie to make up for its lack
of substance. The special effects come early
and often, and, even though they aren't very
good, have a cheesy video game quality that
made me smile. There are a pair of computergenerated monsters at the end of this movie that
I couldn't believe.
If you are excited by any of the things I have
said about this movie, I recommend
you go immediately. If you aren't, Mortal
Kombat: Annihilation will probably
give you a big headache. Based on the success of this flick, we should all be warned: We
haven't seen the last of Kombatl

provide groups of hot new (and naive) blood with entertainment, sex
and drugs; they foot the bills that
the stingy model agencies won't
and they DO expect something in
return.

In general, Bushnell's characters
given aliases to protect theirreal
world identities
range from
model to investment banker, from
artist to housewife. They entertain
themselves in selectively chic SoHo
spots with sex,, gossip and drugs
(ranging from pot and liquor, to cocaine and 'e-tabs') as the main

The Swarthmore Phoenix
After serving as the Budget Committee-Student

Council liaison, I have gained a clear perspective on
the functionality (or lack thereof) of SC. SC needs to
become clear on both A) its specific role in the col
lege community and B) the way in which it will carry
out that role. A: SC is not playing enough of a politi
cal role in the college community. It is a group o
students who have been elected by members of th
student body to represent them, meaning that they
are the voice of students on campus: a voice of sup
Ryan
port, policy questions, concerns, dissatisfactions
whatever it may be, the prominent voice of the stu
Peterson 'OO dent
body is heard via SC. With this in mind, SC
needs to be more accessible, more representative, am
more accountable in its deliberations. B: SC has spent too much tim
micromanaging other groups and committees on campus and needs to be
less of an elitist group of self-important people, but more of public servant
and representatives. SC could accomplish twice as much as it has in th
past if it felt confident in its appointees to various committees and allowed
them to do their job so that THEY could focus on their job. SC has the
potential to be an extremely powerful voice and catalyst for action on cam
pus, but its "power" must be kept in perspective they must always be cog
nizant of the fact that they are SERVANTS to the STUDENT BODY, not to
themselves.

I think one of the most immediate issues that should continue to be ac
dressed, and at some point reach resolution, is that of our campus facilities
The addition and remodeling of several new building over the last severa
years has added greatly to our campus. The talk of new buildings and re
modeling even more building is just as exciting. My committment is tha
the concerns of students be taken into consideration during those discus
sions. Huge amounts of money will be spent on our campus facilities ove
the next twenty years, and I am committed to making sure that the studen
body (present as well as future) has appropriate and accurate representation
on the Board of Managers committees that make those spending decisions
Talk of new dorms, a student center, remodeling Tarble, more or newe
eating facilities, remodeling Parrish, new athletic facilities...all of these ideas
are valid ones but cannot be brought to resolution without the input of the
group of people that will use them most—us. There are numerous things
that will be on the CPC's agenda over the next few years, and it is important
that the CPC member ofSC does the best job that he/she can in representing
the student body's ideas, as well as keeping the student body informed of
what is being discussed at Board meetings.

As Swarthmore College continues to grow and expand, Student Council should be both an active participant and catalyst of that growth and change. Ideally, Student Council serves as a liaison between the
student body and the administration, participating in
decisions which directly effect the College by representing the thoughts of the students. Moreover, Student Council, through events, has the opportunity to
build school unity, an area where Swarthmore is lacking. As a member of Student Council, I would attempt to increase the number of Student CouncilMaureen
sponsored activities throughout the year. AdditionVernon 'Ol
ally, Student Council has the unique ability to shape
the future goals of the College. However, this ability
also includes a political responsibility. Currently, Student Council is not a
sufficiently strong voice in the College community. In order for Student
Council to be successful, students should feel as though they are heard and
represented through the Council. The current situation is unfortunate, because the unique Swarthmore environment is conducive to the exchange of
ideas regarding the College. Unfortunately, we do not take advantage of this
unique environment. An increase in school participation will lead to school
unityrThe future success of the Student Council is undoubtedly contingent
upon student involvement.
Let me begin by saying that I am thrilled about the opportunity to impact
the entire long-range planning process of the College. My primary goal for
the CPC is to increase the involvement of the Student Body in the planning
process. Swarthmore is our school, and the future success of the school is
our responsibility and opportunity. Never in my life have I encountered a
more diversified hub of ideas as I have during my time here at Swat. I have
great confidence in the ability of students here to develop ideas which will
continue Swarthmore College's tradition ofexcellence.
' 2. CPC (1 Year)
Specifically, however, I am interested in the areas of student life and the
modernization of facilities. Student life is a huge part of the Swarthmore
experience, and undoubtedly influences us all. When considering student
life, I will question issues surrounding both social and residential life. Although our academic experiences are enriching, the occurrences outside of
the classroom are often the most memorable experiences of our time here.
Therefore, it is necessary to preserve and increase Student Council sponsored activities. Both Singled Out and the Fall Formal were highly successful events. Fun activities like this not only bring the school community
together, but also provide an alternative to the usual parties. One of my
goals on the CPC would be to increase alternatives to Swat parties. In addition, the poor conditions of several facilities here at Swat, especially the
weight and Nautilus rooms, are truly embarrassing. One only needs to visit
the field house between 3 and 6 pm to realize that the facilities are, to say
the least, lacking. Judging by the crowded conditions which plague the facility in the late afternoon, it is apparent that a great deal of student interest
and investment exists in the pathetic facilities. On the CPC, I would strive to
temporarily and permanently ameliorate the current condition, while ensuring that current plans are continued and followed through upon.

Outreach Chair

When I first came to swat and fell in love with
the people in the campus, I had an idea that I would
be coming to a liberal college, a college that encouraged diversity among students and promoted
the relations among those diverse student. What I
found was a campus filled with many tensions
among groups and people. These tensions, to upkeep the reputation of the college as a tolerant one
are kept under current, and are never really discussed.
Mariel
One of the reasons why these subjects never get
touched upon as a college community is because
Acevedomany people believe that it is the student organizaDiaz'Ol
tions like HOLA, SAO, SASS and SQU who should
deal with racial tensions on campus. Reality is that
if one of these organizations sponsors a discussion,
almost no one from outside that group would attend or participate. Student council is a neutral group that should serve as a mediator between the
groups where tensions are present. As a Student Council member, promoting things as Round Table discussions that would include people with
assorted opinions on different issues, considering it was being run by a
neutral mediator. Events on campus, where different types of activities
combined, like arts and sports, would take place, would combine a spectrum of people that you would normally not encounter together. By working together, we might gain a deeper understanding and tolerance ofeach
other.

Although Student Council meetings are open to everybody on campus,
one rarely finds out when there is a meeting, and if there would be an
agenda that you would be interested in discussing. Letting people know in
advance of SC meetings, and informing the student body of the activities
by providing them an opportunity to be part of them would improve communications between both bodies. Getting out and talking to the people,
wanting to know what they want done is an important part of Student
Council. By knowing what the students want, you can really serve as a

Charity
Miller '9B

As part of Student Council, I would look forward to
learning about how the community can and should be
supported by its elected peers. I have not been involved
in this aspect of Swarthmore in the past, and thus feel I
can bring a fresh perspective, combined with the insight gained by spending 3 and 1/2 years on this campus. I have touched many threads of the community
through activities and hope to incorporate my hindsight
with the goals ofSC. If elected to the College Planning
Committee, I will sincerely try to be a representative
for all swatties, actively recruiting students' thoughts,
opinions, and ideas. I would like to contribute an open
attitude and proactive approach to achieving a successful and efficient Student Council.

I am particularly interested in the changing composition of Swarthmore's
student body, and how the principles of the admissions and financial aid
departments help shape our community as it evolves and thrives. Barry
Schwartz's and Robin Mamlet's article in the Swarthmore College Bulletin
presented a debate worth considering, namely how we admit our students. It
is an issue that affects all of us...our student body is what makes Swarthmore
a unique place. I personally want to see a continued effort to seek out the
intellectual and overall diversity that attracted me to this college. With this in
mind, I of course want the student body to be the primary consideration in the
long-term planning process and will work to assure that we, the students, are
supported by future developments.
As Ari pointed out in his all-campus email today, Student Council has come under some flak' in the recent
past. Perhaps the reason for these brickbats is that the
students view SC not as a resource but as an enforcement agency, which uses its power to punish the innocent community. Thus my goal is to change this image, to ensure that student organizations realize, in
simple Poli Sci 2 terms, that SC is not the Supreme
Court or the Federal Reserve but Congress, As regards
an initiative in this direction, I believe a program alSandip
ready exists in the form ofSC liaisons to student groups.
However, it does not seem to be working very well.
Sukhtankar'oo
Hence, I would urge the liaisons to contact their groups
more frequently, and would collect feedback and report to SC every month sojhat issues could be dealt with efficiently and help
could be provided to ailing activities.
With reference to the second part of the question, the answer, quite simply,
is yes and no. No in the sense that SC needs to have direct involvement with
groups, rather than simply having open meetings and inviting the community.
Yes in that SC plays an important and sometimes controversial role in arbitrating conflicts. In tune with the suggestion of image changing, perhaps SC
can consider alternatives to conflict arbitration, like using the recently formed
mediation group, so that it can truly be an objective body for Swatties, not
only ofSwatties and by Swatties.
It would be very difficult to narrow down my interest in CPC's long-range
planning process to just one topic. In interests of space and specificity, however, the sub-groups I would most like to be involved with are Student Government and Social/Economic investment in the local community. The former
interests me since I feel that it is important that students know about the college's
decision making processes, perhaps as important as taking part in these processes. Spreading this knowledge would entail more sessions like the one organized by the CPC a few Saturdays ago, and I would be more than willing to
help organize more such sessions. Moreover, students attending these sessions are involved in deliberation, and thus indirectly involved in the decision
making process itself. This ensures that issues like the College's investment
policies would not be restricted to a few Conscious Consumers.
The college's role in social and economic interaction in Chester has been
contested recently in many ways. In order to evaluate our eventual mutual
goals better, I envision myself as a contact between this subgroup and a small
group of CIVIC co-ordinators that Pat James (new CIVIC director) wishes to
set up. This would provide more input from the students who actually go into
the locality and know whether and how much the constituents really want
"Swarthmore's help". The irony of Swarthmore and Chester's geographical
proximity could be overcome if both sides views are considered carefully.

Treasurer

Brian
Burnheter 'Ol

If I were elected Student Council Treasurer, I would immediately try to increase Council's contact with the
student body. The more that Council learns about students' wishes and views, the better it can shape its policies to
reflect the student body as a whole. Analogously, I want to encourage students to look at Council as a body whose
purpose is to serve the students. With Council and students setting common goals, everyone will gain from the
work of a strong, unified force. If the community had more faith in Council, perhaps we would see an increase in
the number of candidates for the various openings. The student body would certainly benefit from this increase in
competition; the odds of finding the right person for the job will undoubtedly improve. My main point is that I feel
Council does not play enough of a political role in the college community. Council could do more with the support
of the student body such as propose various referendums or conduct random surveys. If Council were to assert its
voice more without student support, the consequences would be disastrous. However, with the support of the
students, Council's louder voice would not be arrogant or elitist, but rather a harmonious collection of smaller
voices in search of a common cause.

2.
Budget Committee plays an important role in the college community and so it should. The college could not function without careful
budgeting and unbiased allocating of funds. Although it needs considerable power to perform its tasks effectively and efficiently, BC
should not be'able to make decisions without Council approval; Council represents the student body and should therefore have the final
say. Naturally, such a situation could easily cause tension on both sides. While this tension is healthy to a certain degree, excessive levels
will cause BC and Council to bicker, losing sight of their primary goal
promoting the welfare of the student body. Thus, BC must yield
to Council's requests when appropriate and throw aside personal qualms while working hand in hand with Council on a particular issue.
I am not naive however and realize that Council must also cooperate with BC. Council must appreciate BC's efforts and recognize BC as
the vital body that it is. As long as Council and BC commit themselves to voluntary cooperation, both sides will experience mutual gains.
As the student body reaps the benefits of these gains, BC and Council can sit back and take pride in their work, realizing what a big
difference cooperation makes.

keypoint between them and the administration.
If the students felt that the SC was more accessible to them, they would
be more willing to come and talk to SC about what is bothering them,
and what they believe should be done about situations at Swarthmore.
Having meetings specifically designed for students to come in and talk,
say what is on their minds, and arouse issues that they would like for
Student Council to deal with.

1.There are many aspects oflife at Swarthmore
I look forward to addressing through Student
Council. The area I would like to concentrate on
during my term is improving the process of registering for classes. At a college as committed to
the ideals of personal attention and accessibility
as Swarthmore is, it is unacceptable that the possibility exists for a student to get "lotteried out"
ofall four classes s/he plans to take in a semester.
In its present form, the lottery system fails to consider a student's major and any extenuating cirRuth
cumstances about why a certain class is so essential to a specific plan of study. While many stuShoemaker dents
who get "lotteried out" of classes arrange
to be included in the class by talking to the pro'Ol
fessor, this system is inefficient and creates unnecessary work for student and faculty member.
By creating additional sections of classes that are traditionally popular,
Student Council would perform a much needed service to its students. I
am enthusiastic to spearhead such an undertaking. I look forward to
working with other members of Student Council to fine-tune my ideas
about the most expedient ways to go about instituting this change.
As far as the political role Student Council is presently playing as a

voice in the college community, I believe there is room for improvement. As Outreach Chair I would positively effect a
more direct link between the student body and Student Council, which would greatly strengthen Student Council's voice
on campus.
2. In terms of being in touch with the opinions and views of the
student body, Student Council has room for improvement and I am
ready to take on this challenge as Outreach Chair. The experience
I have acquired as president of my class and an executive member of Student Council through high school, and as a member
of the Student Government Planning Sub-Group here at Swarthmore will enhance my ability to efficiently strengthen the link
between Council and the student body. My personal disappointment with Student Council this semester was that the student body was not kept very informed about developments in
the group. I propose to remedy this problem by publicizing
brief weekly updates about the group's progress in The Phoenix and The Weekly News for those who are interested in stay-

ing informed of and involved in the ongoings of Student Council. For those who express interest in a more detailed explanation of Student Council developments, I plan to create a weekly
compilation of concerns, issues, and outcomes addressed by
Council and distribute it to those who are interested via e-mail.
I also plan to make surveys available to the student body as a
way to directly present their opinions and views to Student
Council. Posters announcing major developments will also be
prevalent around campus. As Outreach Chair, my primary goals
would be to strengthen the link between the student body and
Student Council and to act as a voice of the student body at
Council meetings.

Charter Chair
As a candidate for Charter Chair I propose that
the student body become part of a change initiative. If all students become stockholders in the
change process we will be committed towards a
common goal. Change can be accomplished if
students take an active role in the government. The
council can promote diversity when all voices are
heard and there exists an opportunity to interface.
Then no voice is silent and through dialogue and
knowledge transformation will occur. We can then
act upon specific issues that must be explored.
Student council's current role should be adgolomon 'Ol
dressed, since it is not functioning to meet the
needs of the students. The issue of study areas after twelve o'clock is
a concern, since we should examine the feasibility of opening other
areas unless the library hours can be extended. In addition a food court
that is centrally located and student operated during after occurs(l2am
and on) is essential to student life. Perhaps students could also have
input in the daily menu in the cafeteria, expanding the food selection in
an attempt to further nutrition and the desirability of the food. The
lottery process should also be addressed. If a pro active role were
taken by Student Council more sections of a class could be opened so
there is no need for a lottery. This would afford council an opportunity
to function as a governmental body. It will be my mission for change
to take place, so all students are represented as a integral part of a
whole.
It can only be advantageous to consolidate groups under one heading. Therefore, groups are not fragmented and all involved can work
towards an established goal. Each group can then report to Student
Council and the school will have a better awareness of each group's
function. It is not as if groups will lose their independence, since
organizations will still meet and function possessing complete autonomy. The change will occur in the structure, as the groups will be

governed by one body. Efficiency is improved sufficiently by the restructuring of student associations through incorporating the ideas ofmany
into one.
If consolidating is performed with care and attention to preserving the
sovereignty of each group, success will be evident. As Charter Chair I
will make a concerted effort to bring organizations together. This process is not only imperative for group planning and organization, but more
importantly I would use the Charter Chair position to create discourse
between organizations. When students want to initiate a new organization I will encourage them to have activities that involve various student
associations . In general there is very little interaction between groups,
by accomplishing the above this problem can be rectified with ease. There
is no reason that the Charter Chair merely perform the required tasks
dictated by theCharter Committee, without paying attention to the wants
and desires of this campus. The students should have a voice in every
aspect of this campus. I would be interested to find out how the student
body perceives the function of the Charter Committee, in addition the
student's input on Charter issues such as consolidating new organizations.

Matt
Schwartz 'Ol

Student Council's top priority should be building consensus on key issues in order to cure campus apathy towards student government. S.C.
cannot solve this problem alone. I hope to listen
to your thoughts on what issues concern us most,
how student government can best serve us, and
how student government can recapture our imagination and our participation so we can begin to
build consensus and use our collective power.
Below are some ofmy ideas on how student government can improve in the short term:
1 The Budget Committee is too powerful. The

funding of our organizations with our money cannot be left up to a
small, appointed committee. It is undemocratic at best and unjust at
worst. As the Charter Chair holds a seat on 8.C., I would encourage
dissatisfied groups to use the right to a referendum in the Constitution
to put disputed B.C. decisions to a campus-wide vote.
2-Philly is out of reach. If I want to go see a show that runs past
11:30,1need a car, a friend at the U of P, taxi fare, or a park bench. S.C.
should run a shuttle on Friday and Saturday nights from Center City to
encourage the exploration of Philadelphia past our SEPTA-imposed
bedtime.
3.5.C. isn't held accountable. Minutes taken and posted. All meetings, votes, and results, not just available, but publicized.
Give me a call at x5392 if you have an opinion on these ideas or have
some of your own.
2.
The trend is good if it makes it easier for active, contributing groups
to obtain charters. lam only afraid that the consolidation trend might
carry over the budgeting process and each club team, publication, support group, etc. would be forced to fight every other club team, publication, or support group for a designated amount ofmoney earmarked for
their sector. Student Activity Funds should not be divided up into fixed
sectors but allocated on a group-by-group basis. A group's value to the
college community, past performance, and past use of funds should be
taken into consideration first.
The chartering and budgeting process needs to be fluid, so it can adapt
to how sectors and groups change from year to year. As long as consolidation doesn't pigeon-hole groups into separate budget sectors, it
has the potential to make the system much more efficient. Thebest way
to protect groups from the dangers of consolidation is to democratize
the process. I would encourage groups to use their right to a referendum
to overturn budgeting or chartering decisions, as well as experiment
with both systems to involve popular choice wherever practical.

Appointments
1.
No More Useless E-mails! I am not running
entirely on a platform ofreduction in clogging of
your inbox with Student Council e-mails, however, I believe as a representative of the student
body SC needs to realize that students want an
SC that works for them, behind the scenes of their
everyday lives, and does not want to be bothered
by boring e-mails concerning mundane or esoteric topics.
Too many people say that they would love to
on Student Council, but they missed the deadPaul
line, or simply didn't know that an election was
Willenberg 'OO
coming up. I feel that by informing a greater percentage of the student body, we can make sure
that we have a competent, hard-working, and dedicated Student Council. We need all the people who would normally refrain from participating in this process to become involved now.
It is unfair to complain about the problems without becoming involved in a solution. Rather than complaining with the current structure or acting improperly due to frustration, I have been convinced of
the significance of working within the system and correct any of the
improprieties and injustice that is created by its inefficiency.
Specifically, my first priority would be to facilitate the availability of
information to the student body. This would include the requirements
of each position and the number of vacant positions available. Furthermore, students should have the opportunity to view a separate appointments bulletin board that is clear, well-constructed, and userfriendly. Of course, my personal number (a coveted commodity as it
is) would be posted on the bulletin so that students could call me for
any additional questions and concerns.

Because Swarthmore is such a diverse community, we need as a student council to not only represent that diversity but utilize it to our advantage. I will help the committee appoint people who actively exemplify diverse opinions and ideas. As a member of SAC I have seen how
group participants that present and defend very different views can come
together to find a workable and enriched consensus. Furthermore, only
through actively bias committee members can we find the knowledge
and energy to make college committees work both effectively and dynamically.

l. At Swarthmore people tend to think too much
about big plans of the College in the future. I
don't criticize that, but while doing so, they pay
less and less attention to issues that concern the
every-day life of all of us. As a member of Student Council I would definetely concentrate on
balancing these two aspects, by paying more attention to the wants and needs of our student body,
especially of those, who have been forgotten or
not understood. Then I would seek a solution or
a way to meet those wants and needs. One good

at Sharpies, so they have to go to Tarble. The
problem is that they don't get enough credit and
food is also relatively expensive there, so they end up either not eating
enough or paying more. In this case I would first explore all the posible
solutions (giving them extra credit, extending Sharpies hours, creating
more choices for them, like a "lunch bag", etc) and find out through

consideration of the pros and cons ofeach and through surveys, what is
the solution that best meets their needs. This is just one of the many
issues that affect us, as students in our daily life. In my opinion SC is
being an efficient voice of the student body, but it is not very actively
involved, so students tend to forget that it is there to represent them,
and they don't go to it when they need it. SC should get more involved
and involve the others as well, in order to gain the confidence and respect of all of us.
2. As the appointments chair, I would expect my appointees to fulfill
a very active role in our College, since we need students representing
the whole student body, when it comes to make decisions that exclusively concern us. I would focus on appointing responsible and open
minded people, who are able to be objective, even though they have the
chance not to be. They also will have to be aware of the fact that we
have a very diverse student body, with very different needs, which should
always be taken into consideration before making any decision, so everyone could be benefitted from it. I strongly favor the active role,
because it allows students to be creative and to come up with new ideas
and solutions, and that's what we need in order to improve our campus
life. We need motivated people making our decision, and having more
freedom in their choices will motivate them. In order to avoid bias, I
would appoint people with different points of view to the same committee, so everyone could be represented. Another goal as the appointments chair would be trying to get people in the committees closer, in
order to work more efficiently as a team. A posible way of achieving
this is by bringing the appointees together in an informal gathering,
before they actually have a committee meeting, so they can get to know
each other in a less intimidating way. I know being Appointments
Chair represents a lot of responsibilities and commitment, but I am
ready to take all these challenges!

CRC Coordinator
A few changes that would help Student Coun-

cil would be to have more members of the stu-

make a just decision.
As for the specific position of CRC coordinator, I feel that this campus needs a student center. It would be a great addition to Swarthmore
to have a multipurpose building dedicated to the students and used
only by the students. It could be a great place to hang out, watch TV,
play cards and board games, or just chat with a friend. The student
center could also serve as a meeting place for all clubs, an area readily

Personally, I would like to see Student Council
truly fulfill its duties to the Swarthmore Student
Body. However, these duties must be defined. I
see Student Council as a conduit for student activity and concern. I do not see Student Council
playing a political role as a voice in the college
community. We have to be honest with ourselves,
if we are going to support the type of governmental structure that arises from Swarthmore's
rich cultural and socially conscious environment,
then we should support it fully. On this campus,
students are so driven by their own compassion
for the causes they hold dear that there is no need
for Student Council to "get invilved" where Swat

My role as CRC Coordinator would be to, at one level, help Student
Council organize its efforts even better than it has to date. The position
of CRC Coordonator is important. However, what I think is even more
significant is the type of person you put into that position. Allocating
Student Council reserved spaces to college groups really isn't all that
challenging...if you're an organized person. Yet, we must remember
that the person who is elected will be a part of Student Council. Such a
person will have the opportunity to change Student Council from within.
Sure, lots of people can do the job.Yet, how many people will take it one step
further?How many people try to impact the "life" of Student Council and not
just aim to get the job done. I will take it one step...and then some.

Students shouldbe, and are, picking up the slack. Student Council should
be the Student Bodies' personal organizer, so to speak. SC should be
there for students to ask questions about starting new initiatives, working within, and possibly changing, the Swarthmore system of "procedure", keeping students abreast of changes in college policies and most
importantly doing so at a distance. When we ask Student Council to play a
political role, we give it a power and a responsibility that it should not have.
This isn't high school anymore. We are capable young adults who will get the
job done. Let Student Council show you the "how". You make it happen.

lines in the Daily Gazette or Phoenix about upcoming meetings could help solve this problem.
Giving the e-mail address of the co-chairs for
all students interested in SC meetings is another
possibility. Also, I feel SC has overlooked the
Budget Committee's decisions and should be
extremely cautious of overturning decisions
made by a group offellow students. For important issues involving where SC is asked to approve or overrule a previous mandate, it would
be helpful for SC to have a joint meeting with
the other group, such as Budget Committee, to

available to student groups for meetings or storage space for various equipment. Aside from a student center, I think it would also be helpful for
clubs to publicize their various activities in a newsletter available to everyone so that more people can find things that interest them, and I am
sure that clubs would be happy to have more members. Thank you for
your consideration.

Men's basketball faces an uphill climb
With a young team and an interim coach, Garnet men's
basketball dropped first six games in close contests
*

?W^At«l<bltDbNAGHY

"•<-V ">■■.;. ■ "�—;
The men's basketball team has a
new Idbk this year, as 5 of last

year's top 7 players have graduated.
Last year's seniors accounted for
over 70% of the team's scoring, rebounding, and assists, and they led
the Garnet to the conference finals.
Also absentfrom this year's lineup
is long time head coach Lee
Wimberly, who is taking a year's
sabbatical. In his place, Brad
Hoffman '93 has taken the reins as

coach.
Two exOlosive players, junior tricap&irfs Titn Schofield and J.J.

Hopkins. Purdy, coming off a hand
injury that kept him out of the
Garnet's first two games, is the
team's second returning scorer and
leading rebounder. A strong supporting staff led by senior tri-captain Doug Rouse and sophomores
J.T Haskins, Cassidy Westbrook,
and Greg Holtmeier has been getting better each game as they gain
more experience.
The Garnet have run into early
troubles so far, losing their first six
games of the season to date.
Swarthmore opened the season by
hosting Washington & Lee in the
opening round of the Equinox Tournament. The Garnet fell behind
early to the Generals and were
downby 12 with seven minutes left,
but they staged a comeback. Rouse
and Haskins accounted for four
three pointers as Swarthmore was

able to tie the game, before W & L
took a two point lead with just seconds remaining. Unfortunately, a
three pointer at the buzzer bounced
off the front of the rim to end the
game at 50-48. Haskins finished
with 18 points, with Mike Schall
'99 adding 10 points and 7 rebounds.
The Garnet then dropped the consolation game to Vassar 50-46.
Swat held the lead for most of the
game, but could not hold on. J.T.
Haskins once again played a strong
game and was named to the AllTournament team.
The Garnet traveled to GwyneddMercy to play the second of their
10 game road trip. "We started out
slow and turned the ball over a lot
in the beginning. It put us into a
hole that was tough to get out,"
noted J.P. Harris '99. The Garnet

made a run at the end of the half,
but could not close the gap any
closer than 8 in their 77-51 defeat.
Hoping to end their losing streak,
the Garnet took the bus to Rochester, NY to play in the Chuck Reiser
tournament. In the opening round,
Swarthmore met Savannah Arts &
Design. The Garnet lost 50-66, but
"the score did not reflect how close
the game really was" one player
noted. "We were right with them
until they pulled away at the end"
added Schofield. J.J. Purdy led the
squad with 11 points, as Holtmeier,
in his first career start, added 10
points and six rebounds.
In the consolation game, the Garnet clashed with Union, yet another
tough foe. Determined to play their
best basketball, Swat came out firing and took a 30-27 lead at the
half. Union then went on a second
half run that the Garnet could not
stop, and pulled away to a 78-62
win, sending Swarthmore's record
to 0-5 heading into conference
play. Rouse led Swarthmore with
16 points off the bench, with

Westbrook chipping in 9 points and
5 assists. Swarthmore set a Centennial record with 10 three pointers in the game.
Swarthmore then traveled to
Johns Hopkins, where the Garnet
won last year in the playoffs. The
Garnet fell behind early, but hung
tough with the Blue Jays for most
of the game despite disadvantages.
"Our defense was good, considering the height difference. The
Hopkins players were 4 or 5 inches
taller than us," said Harris. With
12 minutes to go, Swarthmore finally went on a scoring spree and
cut the deficit to 3 before Hopkins
had to call a timeout. After the
timeout, the game changed and
Swarthmore could do nothing to
stop the Blue Jays, as Swat dropped
its sixth game 67-51.
Inexperience and a tough opening schedule have victimized the
Garnet so far. Commenting on the
season thus far, coach Hoffman
noted: "Our last four games were
against very good basketball teams,
and we played well for most of the

game. The final scores do not reflect how close the games were."
Asked if the lack of experience
has played a factor, Hoffman responded, "We're young and we're
still trying to define roles. It's not
easy to play varsity games the first
couple times out. There has been
major improvement each game.
The games have been close, but we
don't know how to win just yet."
"It's been a tough first semester"
added Schofield. "But we are seeing improvement. Coach Hoffman
has been doing a great job so far.
He's doing everything he can to
help us win. The team has remained positive."
With such a tough beginning
schedule, including future games
against Division I Yale and
Lafayette, the Garnet should be
ready to make another conference
playoff run. Coach Hoffman has
explained to the players that at
times, they have looked unstoppable. As the young players continue to develop, the team will gel
and once again be a contender.

The women's basketball team
opened their season with a third
place finish at Williams College's
Tip-Off Tournament, but dropped
two Straight conference games to
to 1-3 overall, 02 in,the,Centennial Conference.
Tls%\flft-facetfUte,*>st. Willin the first
gamenif foe tournament and displayed a remarkable defensive intensity. Swat was behind by only
12 points at the half to a bigger,
deeper team that went to the
NCAA tournament last year. In the
second half, the Garnet could not
match the Cows' and Williams'
lead continued to increase. The final score was 81-39. Co-captain
Jean Quinn '99 had 12 points and
9 rebounds, and point guard
Kri?ten English 'Ol had ten points.
In the second game of the tour-

nament, the Garnet defeated Notre
Dame College, 69-45. Holly
Barton '99 lit up the court from the
outside, scoring a career high 31
points. Nancy Craig 'Ol and
Heather Marandola 'Ol each had
10 points in the contest. English
was awarded all-tournament honors for her dazzling performances
bringing the ball up the court and
penetrating to the hoop.
Swat's first conference game was
against Johns Hopkins, who also
advanced to the NCAA tournament
last year. The Blue Jays overpowered the Garnet, 77-38. Marandola
and Co-Captain Michelle Walsh
'9B each had 12 points.
Against conference foe Washington, the Garnet started out flat and
were down at the break. A valiant
second half effort showed the
Garnet's ability to score and to
stifle their opponent defensively;
however the damage had already

been done and the Shorewomen
were victorious, 68-43. Two players for the Garnet just missed
double-doubles: Marandola had
11 points and 9 rebounds and
Quinn had 14 boards and 9 points.
English and Walsh had 7 points
apiece.
Coach Adrienne Shibles said, "We
need to find a way to come mentally
and physically prepared to play 40
minutes of basketball. In the past
few games, we have had trouble in
the second half." Shooting percentage is another problem area for the
Garnet. Swat hit only 29% of their
field goals in the last game, compared with Washington's 44%.
"There were some bright spots in the
game against Washington," continued Shibles. "Our offensive movement looked good in the second half,
and the entire team never gave up.
One thing I could never accuse this
team of having is a lack ofheart on

the court."

"Jean Quinn and Heather
Marandola have been very consistent for us. Jean is averaging 7
points per game, and is one of the
top rebounders in the conference,
averaging 10.5 per game. Heather
is averaging 9.8 points per game
and 6.8 rebounds per game as a
shooting guard," said Shibles.
Walsh leads the conference with 5
steals per game and Marandola is
second with 3.8, a testament to
Swarthmore's defensive intensity.
"We are forcing opposing teams
into lots of turnovers, but need to
do a better job of taking care of the
ball ourselves," she said.
The team will participate in the
annual Seven Sisters Tournament
this Friday, Saturday, and Sunday at
Haverford. They play Vassar Friday
at 6pm, and will face either Smith or
Haverford Saturday at 2pm or 4pm.
All are invited to attend.

The past two weeks have been
full ofups and downs for the men's
and women's swim teams, winning
big against both Drew and Widener
but losing big to Division I University of Pennsylvania.
Swat's men and women dominated the individual events against
Drew. Becca Howes-Mischel 'Ol
and Mari McCrann 'OO placed first
and second in the women's 1000
yard freestyle, while Mark
Friedberg '9B and Brent Wasser 'OO
finished second and third for the
men. The women's 200 yard free
wasjswept by Molly Marino '9B,
Claire Arbour 'OO, and Liz Blair
'00; Carl Sanders '9B won it for the
men. The 50 freestyle was won by
Hillary Clay 'Ol and Andy Robbins
'9B. Melissa Amir-Arjomand 'OO
and Paul Dickson 'OO also had excellent swims, placing second and
third respectively. Ryan Fruh '99,
Ted Sherer 'Ol, Kevin O'Neil 'Ol,
and Nik Johnson 'Ol all outswam
Drew's men 100 freestylers by
placing first, second, third, and
forth in this event. Proving that
Swat swimmers are strong in all
strokes, Arbour and Alissa

Parmelee 'Ol took first and second
in the women's 200 yard Individual
Medley, while Walsh and Sherer

finished first and third for the men.
Widener also put up a fight, but
again, Swarthmore overpowered
their competition. The men and
women both won their medley relays, and the women went on to win
all but two individual events. Erica
Rosenthal 'OO finished the 1000
yard freestyle with a first place finish as well as a personal best time.
Kristin Robertson '9B and Parmelee
fought each other for a very close
first and second place in the 200
IM. Elisabeth Newcomb 'OO displayed her talent by winning the

100 yard butterfly, and Marni
Shultz 'Ol swam a great race, finishing third in the same event. Clay
got her first collegeite win in the

100 yard freestyle, followed by

Robertson and Blair in second and
third place.
The men's team also took control,
winning all but three events against
Widener. The two distance events,
the 1000 and 500 yard freestyle,
were won by Walsh and Friedberg
respectively. Fruh won the 200 Individual medley, with Wasser right
after him for third place. Robbins,
Dickson, and GabeTurzo 'Ol came
in first, third, and fourth in the 100
yard backstroke. In the final individual event of this meet, the 100
yard breaststroke, Fred Gerson '99
and Sherer came in first and sec-

ond.
Even though the final score of the
last meet came out in favor of U.
Penn, there were still many impressive Swat swims. For instance, the
medley relay of Robbins, Gerson,
Walsh, and Sanders gave Penn a
real run for their money, finishing
just out of first place. Arbour won
the 100 free and placed second in
the 200 IM, proving that she is
tough competition for anyone.
Rosenthal swam a great race in the
difficult 400 IM event, finishing
second, as did Blair in the 500
freestyle. As always, the men
breaststrokers, Sherer, Gerson, and
Fruh, were very successful, winning Swarthmore's only first-second-third place finish in this meet.
Going into the meet against Penn
this Wednesday, the men's team
held a perfect 5-0 record, with the
women right next to them at 4-1.
While the meet put a dent in their
overall records, both teams remain
undefeated in the Centennial con-

ference.
The team will travel to Western
Maryland this Saturday for their
last meet of the semester.

Swat wrestlers progress at Princeton

Oh Saturday November 22, the
Swarthmore wrestling team traveled to Princeton for their first dual
meet experience of the season. Six
teams participated, each wrestling

three dual matches. Participating
teams were, Princeton, Columbia,

Montclair State, New York University, Wagner, and Swarthmore.
Swat wtestled Division I teams
Columbia and Princeton, as well as
Division 111 powerhouse Montclair
State: Although the team fell to

Swarthmore wrestled respectably,
although hampered by the inability to cover all thirteen weight
classes. Wrestling Princeton first,

Sean Lewis 'OO, and Pete Balvanz
'9B, put Swarthmore on the board.
Sean posted a pin at heavy weight
and Pete won by major decision at
158 pounds. Despite the win, Pete
felt that he was, "a bit hesitant offensively, and it showed."
Swarthmore wrestlers next faced
Columbia. Their only points resulted from Pete Balvanz's win by
decision. In the last match,
Swarthmore fell prey to Montclair
State. Freshman Ben Gaines made
a name for himself, though, pinning
his opponent at 125 pounds to give
the Garnet their 6 points. This
match was extremely tough for
Swat after the first two extremely
physical matches. 'The fatigue of
12 intense minutes of prior wrestling beat me," said Balvanz, who
unfortunately suffered a fall in this
match.
Despite the disappointing losses,
"the exposure to a theoretical

higher level of competition was
positive for the team, and if something is learned from each match
regardless of the outcome, progress
is being made," commented
Balvanz. The team is looking forward to the second half of the season when they begin wrestling
teams from the Centennial Conference and the competition heats up.
This Saturday, December 6th,
Swarthmore hosts Cheyney and
SUNY Maritime in a tri-meet at
home. The team then takes a break
until January 7th, when they
wrestle Lebanon Valley and
Davidson College at home at
6:oopm. In addition, Swat will be
hosting the Team Challenge Tournament and the Swarthmore Invitational on Jan. 10th and 16th respectively, as well as wrestling both
Centenary College and Roger Williams University in dual meets over
winter break.
