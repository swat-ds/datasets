Budgets to
face five
percent cut
Academic departments and compensation to remain unaffected;
belt will tighten on other areas
BY BENJAMIN KABAK
bkabakl@swarthmore.edu
To offset recent endowment portfolio losses while maintaining competitive compensation packages, the College Budget
Committeeand the President's Office have requested five percent
budget cuts in most non-academic departments. After years of
growth, the

endowment has gone down for the first time since

1983.

Officials view the cuts as a reallocation of resources from
older and less useful programs to newer and more valuable ones.
No academic areas will suffer, and there will be no faculty or staff
salary reductions or layoffs.
"We put together a budget that will meet compensation goals
in such a way that no one will have to go to bed worried about
their job not being there in the morning," said Paul Aslanian,
vice president for finance and planning.

"To create a balanced budget and to
meet new unavoidable expenses, we
had to pull back on other expenses
across the institution."

Applicants and early acceptances rise as
admissions admits 892 to class of '06
BYSETHSIAS
\ssiasl@swarthmore.edu
Thousands of high school seniors ended months of
waiting and watching their mailboxes this week as
738 received acceptance letters from Swarthmore.
T hey join the 154 students admitted through early
decision to form the admitted class of 2006. The college
expects the final class size to number about 375.
The acceptance rate dropped this year to 23 percent, although it did not reach the 19 percent low of
|he class of 2003. Applications also went up this year,
to above 3,900, the approximate number of
applicants for the class of 2004. The number dipped to
3>500 last year.
As usual, New York, at 16 percent, and California,
at 11 percent, were the most common home states of
admitted students, accounting for more than one
Quarter of the class. This year, Pennsylvania became
the fourth most represented state after being third in
the last two classes. New Jersey, previously fourth,
moved up to third, and Texas, Illinois and Florida also
in representation.

Admitted students hailed
T HE PHOENIX

from all 50 states, 39

countries, Puerto Rico, Washington, D.C., and the U.S.
Virgin Islands. More international students came
from Canada than any other country. France,
Pakistan and Thailand came next.
Around 12 percent of the admitted students were
African-American, 14 percent were Latino and 16 percent were Asian-American. The percentage of
African-American students rose this year but was not
as high as it was two years ago. In 2001, the student
body was eight percent African-American, 15 percent
Asian-American and eight percent Latino, according
to the college's 2001 fact book.
The college accepted more students through early
decision this year than ever before. There was only a
five-student increase, but that put early decision students at 40 percent of the class.
The percentage of class members from public high
schools remained steady at 57 percent, while the proportion of students from private high schools declined
slightly to 29 percent.
Parochial schools accounted for six percent of the
class, a slight rise from the previous four percent.
International students made up seven percent of the
class.

The belt tightening will not affect the newly approved minimum staff wage and compensation offers. "We have made a special commitment to the staff to create a minimum wage of $9 an
hour as well as to bring out staff compensation up to the bench-

marks reflecting compensation in the region and at comparable
colleges," President Al Bloom said.
The new staff wage, combined with the endowment's decline,
has exhausted most of the new funds that would have been available for next year's budget, Bloom added. "To create a balanced
budget and to meet new unavoidable expenses, we had to pull
back on other expenses across the institution," he said.
Aslanian explained how the CBC and the President's Office
arrived at five percent as the target number for the cutbacks.
"When we looked at requests for next year, we had $363,000 available for new expenditures, and we had requests of around
$900,000," he said.
To reconcile the difference, the committees knew that a three
percent cut would be necessary, Aslanian said. They increased
the cut to five percent to create a cushion in case some departments could not meet their goals.
"We set out to find things we could cut back which would not
endanger anyone's job and would not compromise the quality of
the college's programs," Bloom said. Plans now include cutting
supply costs and unnecessary food and travel expenses.
So far, college departments have met the cuts with acceptance.
"I think people accept the necessity of it," Dean of the College
Bob Gross '62 said. "It's not unreasonable to think that there is a
thin layer of fat that can be scrapped off our budget. No one has
found that it will affect services in a negative way."
Gross explained that most departments will lose what usually
ends up being an annual built-in surplus, not essential services.
"In some areas, cutting is not really necessary because we had
money left over at the end of the year," Gross said. "It's more of
a tightening of finances, but it's going to leave departments feelSee BUDGET,

First-years dominate
new appointments

phoenix.swarthmore.edu

BY MARY MINTEL

mmintell@swarthmore.edu

On March 26, the Concessions Committee chose new directors for
Paces, the Student Employment Office (SEO) and the Student Activities
Committee (SAC). The committee also hired coordinators for the
evening shuttle service. Except for the SAC co-directors, first-years
hold all the positions.
The Concessions Committee was composed of previous SEO officers
Terrence Seales 'O2 and William Williams 111 'O2, and a student council
officer Chirag Chotalia 'O4. Dean of Student Life Tedd Goundie,
Director of Financial Aid Laura Talbot and Social Affairs Committee
Coordinator Jenny Yim also served on the committee.
Especially notable were the first-years chosen to direct SEO.
Usually, two upperclassmen hold the position. "I think we were the
only ones that applied, basically," said Yubraj Acharya 'O5 new codirector .
Acharya and his partner Ante Jelcic 'O5 said they plan to continue
the job categorization process that the last SEO directors started. The
present job descriptions are six to seven years old, according to
Acharya, and there are not clear records of the number and nature of
campus jobs. They have requested that all employers fill out job
descriptions. From these, they will determine into which pay scale
each job falls.
Acharya and Jelcic also want to improve the accessibility of SEO.
They plan to create a Web site so that students can fill out their time
slips online and also want to improve SEO office hours, especially on
weekdays.
"We certainly want to make things easier for everyone in terms of
contacting SEO," Acharya said. Jelcic explained, "We have office hours
every day. If people cannot make these times, we are always accessible
by e-mail or appointment."
Evening shuttle coordinators Paul Maurizio 'O5 and Garret Ash 'O5
have held their positions since December, when Public Safety turned
over van service to students.
The two want to restore student drivers to the shuttles. Maurizio
and Ash have been putting together a schedule since December, and
students will begin driving the evening shuttles April 22.
According to Ash and Maurizio, a positive response from students
has eased initial concerns that there would not be enough students who
wanted to drive shuttles. "We've gotten a really good response,"
Maurizio said. "We've found a lot of dedicated drivers." Their main
concern is that the shuttles remain timely and safe. "Public Safety is
relying very heavily for students to take responsibility with this,"
Maurizio said.
The only new hires who are not first-years are SAC co-directors
Sean Brandveen 'O3 and Chris Morello 'O3. Brandveen said their goal
was to "just improve the social life any way we can." They are interested in obtaining more student input and hope to poll students next
semester on "what they feel is lacking in the social events on campus."
Brandveen and Morello also need to address monetary issues.
"There's a little bit of problems with budgeting," Brandveen said. "[We
need to] make the money we do have go a little bit further." They are
not sure how much money they have to work with yet, since they will
not be meeting with the Student Budget Committee until April 14.
They are interested in finding a way to distribute the money so that
there are not just five groups using up to 80 percent of the budget,

Brandveen said.
Brandveen and Morello are both brothers in Delta Upsilon, which
traditionally plays a substantial role in SAC. Last year, the co-directors
were not members of DU, but usually about a fourth of the committee
is. "It's never been something that we as a group shoot to dominate,"
Brandveen said. "We just want to get involved with the campus."
Brandveen is enthusiastic about his new position. "I think it's one
of the more important positions, because, with Swarthmore being such
a stressful place, one of the most important things we can provide is an
outlet for that stress," he said.
Brandveen and Morello will do most of their planning over the summer, since they live about 15 minutes from one another on Long Island.
Carmen Barron 'O5 and Jonathan Fombonne 'O5, the new Paces codirectors, have major plans for improving the cafe. Barron has worked
at Paces two semesters as a dishwasher, and Fombonne as a bartender,
so the two have witnessed many of the positive and negative features
of the cafe.
Fombonne is in charge of coordinating the weekend parties, while
Barron will control the time slips and budget of the cafe. They have
plans to renovate the space, replacing the tables and chairs, redoing the
bench area and putting in a new tile floor. They would also do a major
cleaning and purchase new appliances for the kitchen. "Paces has
become rundown with use over the years," Barron said.
They are also looking into the feasibility of installing a permanent
sound system and hope to create a Web site with menus along with an
online schedule so that students can reserve the space for parties.

Chela Delgado presents cost-of-living data at last week's Living Wage

&

Democracy Campaign rally.

Rally pushes for higher wages
BY LILLIE DREMEAUX

ldremeal@swarthmore.edu

Following a recent recommendation from the
Compensation Review Committee (CRC) to
increase Swarthmore's minimum wage from $6.66
to $9, the Living Wage and Democracy Campaign
held a rally to support the college's action and to
urge it to institute what the campaign has determined is a "living wage" for all its workers.
A series of speakers, poets and comedy acts
pushed the college to implement the $l3 hourly
wage and credited the campaign with shedding
light on staff issues and prompting the college to
use factors besides the market to determine staff
wages.
The crowd of over 100 comprised mostly students, some faculty and staff, and several members
of the administration, including President Al
Bloom and Vice President Maurice Eldridge '6L
The rally, called "Keep on Movin' Forward,"
was part of the third annual April 4 National
Student Labor Day of Action. The day is the
anniversary of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s
assassination, which took place while he was supporting a 1968 strike for .sanitation workers in
Memphis.
Following a brief moment of silence to honor
King's legacy, Chela Delgado 'O3 explained the considerations behind the $l3 hourly "living wage"
that the campaign has advocated. The wage takes
into account the cost of such basic needs of food,
housing, clothing and employer-subsidized health
care in the area.
Delgado congratulated the college's decision to
increase the campus minimum wage. "That is
progress," she said of the new wage. "While that is
great, and that's really going to make a difference
in a lot of folks' lives, it's not a living wage, and
that's why we want to keep on moving forward."
She then gave the stage to a group of "radical
cheerleaders," who chanted cries like, "When I say
'living,' you say 'wage'! 'Living!' 'Wage!' 'Living!'
'Wage!' When I say 'democracy,' you say 'now'!
'Democracy!' 'Now!' 'Democracy!' 'Now!'
They
appeared at interludes throughout the rally, with
cheers comically blasting "rich white men" and the
college's investment of its endowment in stocks.
Psychology professor Barry Schwartz emphasized the campaign's influence in getting the college to consider ethical factors in determining
wages. The college, he said, was "nudged in the
direction it has moved by the people involved in
the living wage campaign.
"You people said it, and you were taken seriously," he said.
"

Hamza Wali, an Environmental Services worker who's backed the campaign since its inception,
called a living wage a reachable goal. The college
needs to "strengthen the weak without weakening
the strong," he said, adding that he did not want
anyone to misunderstand the living wage camApril

paign as part of a "welfare movement."
Rajaa Shakir 'O4, not a campaign member, read
a poem about economic disparity and poverty as
culture. The poem was inspired by her experience
working in an AETNA mailroom one summer as
part of an all-black staff working for $8 an hour
under about 80 percent white management, she

said.
She prefaced the reading by saying she did not
understand how Swarthmore could claim to
"instill its students with a sense of moral intelligence" while ignoring students' demands for justice and disregarding its "social obligation to try to
provide all the members of their community with
economic stability and personal autonomy."
Emma Benn 'O4, also not a campaign member,
read a poem about wage inequality, asking "How'd
I get so lucky, 'cause no one set no trap for me?"
She acknowledged the role of education in deciding wages but repeated the demand that the college
pay enough for workers to support their families.
Michelle Hartel, who works at Kohlberg Coffee
Bar, thanked the campaign for publicizing staff
concerns. She had realized that these concerns
often went unnoticed while serving on the Staff
Advisory Council (SAC) several years ago. "Until
the student body got involved, it didn't seem like
we had a voice," Hartel said.
Campaign members Delgado and Kim Bussey
'O4 offered the audience some "quick facts" about
the living wage movement.
Illustrating the relative cost to the college of
increasing workers' wages, Bussey said that the
already established jump to $9 an hour was going
to cost the college about $30,000 a year. One-tenth of
one percent of the endowment is $900,000.
Twenty-seven college campuses and 75 local
communities nationwide are pushing for a living
wage, Bussey said. Delgado highlighted the success
of Harvard's living wage campaign, whose 22-day
sit-in last year brought on national media attention, endorsements from celebrities, and the university's decision to up the minimum wage to
$10.83 and SIL3O an hour.
Delgado also requested a round of applause for
the staff in attendance, claiming that in general
there was "fear among staff at Swarthmore."
Delgado said she knew of at least one staff member
who had wanted to attend the rally but did not
because her supervisor had told her not to go.
She addressed students and faculty, asking that
they use their "privilege and power" to make the
campus a place where staff feel free to speak out.
The rally concluded with Alana Price 'O4,
Louisa Strouse Boiman 'O4 and Al Bradbury 'O4
singing "Keep on Movin' Forward," a spiritual.
The Living Wage and Democracy Campaign
will sponsor a speaker from the housekeepers'
union at the University of North Carolina for the
April 26 collection as well as an educational event
with Radical African Descent on living wage and
race issues on April 24.

Reporters' Notebook: The Abercrombie

&

Fitch photo shoot

Style and sex: Abercrombie comes to campus
BY MATTHEW FITTING AND CARLA GREENBERG
mfittinl@swarthmore.edu and cgreenbl@swarthmore.edu
Like the Abercrombie and Fitch Web site will tell you, its
quarterly magazine is "more than just a catalog." The site
goes on to say that the "magalogue," as it's called by the A&F
staff who put it together, is "irreverent, unbiased and sexy."

All those words could describe the Abercrombie Fitch
photo shoot that visited campus last Thursday (except maybe
"unbiased"). The production brought with it four caterers,
two seamstresses, four hair stylists, about two dozen Budget
rental cars, roughly 30 models and one very famous fashion
photographer (Bruce Weber, who according to one Web site is
probably responsible for mainstreaming the homoerotic
image in advertising). For at least one day, Swarthmore's sexiness quotient was considerably elevated.
After all, it's not every day that glancing outside a Sharpies
window during lunch can produce the following scene: four
seriously beautiful people, three guys and one girl, all bopping
around to the Beatles' "Come Together," while a short, stocky
man in a black sweater, beret and pink scarf snaps photo after
photo. Said man is surrounded by assistants who do all the
work for him. When one of his several cameras is out of film,
they remove it and place in his waiting hands another newly
loaded camera, ready to shoot.
The three male models, of course, have their pants pulled
down around their ankles, with chefs hats on their heads,
showing off A&F boxer-briefs. If you listen closely, you can
hear them chatting, trying to impress the girl:
"I'm the naked chef!"
So why Swarthmore? Ask Sam Shahid, the shoot's artistic
director: "It gave the look we wanted," he said. "This one just
had the look we wanted, sort of that Ivy league look."
Or Damon Reynolds, a "magalogue" editor who lives near
Swarthmore: "A lot of people referred it," he said.
"Swarthmore was on everyone's lips as far as a place to go."
&

Also, according to Shahid, the "magalogue" editors wanted
to capture the feeling of, "Kids in school, learning to be chefs,
stuff like that." The "kids" picked to portray those students
are not your average fashion models. In fact, A&F says it usually will only hire "found" models. According to Shahid, they
can come from anywhere. "A lot of them are found in colleges,

beaches," he said.
Though these kids are unusually beautiful, they seem to
see themselves as very much like the students here at
Swarthmore. Self-described as ages 18 to 22, most are in college: at UC Santa Barbara, or Santa Monica College. Though
many were natives of California, others were from homes as
diverse as Green Bay, Wis., Rochester, N.Y., Maui and the former Czechoslovakia. Each came to the modeling business
(and the A&F shoot) through different avenues: auditions in
Los Angeles, getting picked off the beach, through agents. One
had been an employee in an Abercrombie store.
Ryan Toner, from Los Angeles, said it was strange "to be
gawked at, because we're just like you. I'll bet there are plenty of people on this campus who could be doing this job."
All of the models were very excited to be on the A&F shoot.
"Working with Bruce Weber is amazing. You get jobs just from
working with him," Holly Lynch of Venice Beach, Calif., said.
Toner agreed. "Abercrombie gives you so much exposure," he

said.

So could the same be said of Swat? Will an appearance in
the much-anticipated, much-read (or at least skimmed) backto-school issue give us exposure? And is that a good thing?
Tom Krattenmaker, director of the Office of News and
Information, seemed to think so. "P.R. is never a precise science, so it's hard to tell exactly what an institution gets out
of this," he said. "But I can tell whatI think we get, and that's
visibility."
Krattenmaker
said that not only the fashion
world but also the world
in general
would give

Swarthmore more attention after its Abercrombie appearance. "Many young people, some of whom may be prospective students, could read the catalogue and become aware of
Swarthmore," he said.
And

though

Abercrombie

sought

out the

college,

Krattenmaker said accepting the shoot was part of the college's ongoing mission to become "better known, better appreciated. And if that's your premise, then you want to cooperate
with people to make that happen."

Conference features business alums
BY JARED LENOW
jlenowl@swarthmore.edu

Cubicles, memos, board meetings and a
social conscience? Corporate America doesn't
exactly have the best reputation among social
activists, but maybe it would if more Swatties
traded in their Birkenstocks for a pair of
black patent leather shoes.
More than 150 Swarthmore students,
alumni, parents and faculty attended the allday
2002
Lax
Conference
on
Entrepreneurship last Sunday. The conference featured separate keynote addresses by
CEOs Tralance Addy '69 and Mickey Herbert
'67 as well as panel discussions on venture
Philanthropy, the promise and pitfalls of
entrepreneurship, and the nuts and bolts of
running a small business.
"What's important to take away from the
conference was that Swarthmore prepares
people to do all kinds of things and go out and
change the world in all kinds of ways,"
Director of Career Services Tom Francis.
"The major benefit is the sense of mutual supPort people get for doing activities that aren't
often visibly supported at Swat but are ofreal
worth to society and the people who do them."
Addy is the founder, president and CEO of
Plebys International LLC, a venture development and management company, and the
CEO of Water Health International, a Plebyssupported company that seeks to provide
clean water to those in need. He spoke of the
diverse range of individuals who can become
successful engineers and the drive and willingness to take chances needed to achieve

success.

"The whole notion that someone can look

at you when you're 12 and say, 'You're an
entrepreneur,' I challenge," he said. "A lot of

Herbert, the founder and former CEO of a
major HMO and current president, CEO and
majority owner of the Bridgeport Bluefish
Baseball Club, spoke of the difficultly of staying determined when starting out on a new
project.
"There are very few get-rich-quick
schemes," he said. "And there are even fewer

ones that work."
Herbert spoke of how his involvement
with the Bluefish allowed him to help revive
an economically depressed city, enjoy his
time in the "office" and make a solid investment.

The keynote speeches preceded two concurrent panel discussions, "Building a New

Richard Barasch '75, Caroline Curry '9O,
Timothy Sibley '9B and Brian George Smith

attendees and participants.
"The conference is a good thing for Swat to
have, as the attitude of most Swarthmore students is very anti-business, anti-corporation,
and, thus, anti-entrepreneurial," said
attendee Tim Lang 'O4. "I think there's a lot of
misconceptions about what entrepreneurship
actually is and what it involves. You can
achieve some important social goals through
entrepreneurship."

Ex-IBM exec takes up Afghan women's cause

browsing through its Web site late one night.

On the eve of the National Day of Silence,
sponsored by the Intercultural Center (IC),
Mirchandani shared her experiences as a
feminist and human rights activist in a presentation entitled, "Revolutionary Asso

and Images You Won't Get on the 6 O'clock
News."

"I spent three days and three nights
hooked on the [RAWA] Web site," she said.
"As a woman, a human being, it was the
most horrible thing I had seen, but I was
humbled, because the Afghan women were
resisting what had happened to them."
Mirchandani serves on the Board of
Directors for the Afghan Women's Mission,
an organization that works closely with the
Revolutionary Association of the Women of

explained. RAWA has programs both in
Afghanistan and Pakistan. It runs 33

Mirchandani also described the condition of Afghan women and children.
Although there was a difference between
urban and rural women, women were
allowed to walk with their heads uncovered
in the 1960s and '7os. In the urban areas,
forty percent of doctors and 70 percent of
teachers were Afghan women. Under
oppression, many are widows and have
resorted to prostitution and begging for survival.
As for the children, 100 are buried every
day. Afghan or Pakistani children are
known as "children of garbage," the breadwinners of the family. They earn six cents
for every 12 kilograms of garbage collected.
"If we as a human race cannot solve the
Afghan problem,

Dining Services introduces new 17-meal plan
Targeting athletes, plan will provide students with 65 points and added dining flexibility
BY

CATHY DANH
cdanhl@swarthmore.edu

In order to provide students with more dining flexibility, Dining Services announced the creation of a 17-meal
plan this week. The new meal plan will provide 65 points
and will be available to students beginning in the fall.

meal plan earlier this semester to Vice President of
Facilities Larry Schall '75.
Both Schall and McDougall "were receptive to the idea
from the beginning," Budish said. "It was just a matter of
finding the number of meals and points to make it work.
Seventeen meals doesn't mess up the budget for Dining
Services."

The new plan provides students with a middle ground
for dining options. It includes the flexibility of the 14-meal
plan, without the constraints of the 20. The bonus of the
new plan is that it features 65 points and the convenience

of carryover meals.
The goal of the new plan is to provide students with
more choices in dining options. The 17-mealplan will provide "added convenience to students," Director of Dining
Services Linda McDougall said. "I think this is a good meal
plan for students who eat breakfast occasionally, but not

daily."

Student Council Campus Life Representative Ryan
Budish 'O4, who conceived the new plan, believed the existing arrangements were too constraining. The 20-meal plan
does not have much flexibility. While the 14-meal plan
offers 125 points it may not provide enough meals for many
students, according to Budish.
The new 17-meal plan is "targeted toward students on
the 20-meal plan," Budish said. "Many of those on the 20meal plan don't eat 20 meals, but they do not eat as few as
14 either. [The 17-meal plan] meets those people's needs."
Budish, along with fellow Campus Life Representative
Ed Stehlik 'O5, proposed the idea to create an additional

breakfast two or three days a week. These "athletes felt
constrained to be on the 20-meal plan," Budish said. "My
hope is that 17 meals will meet the flexibility of those
individuals."
Student response to the meal plan has been mixed.
Some athletes believe that they will take advantage of the
new option, but many do not.
Varsity track and field athletes James Golden 'O5 and
Garret Ash 'O5, both on the 20-meal plan, recognize the
added convenience of the 17-meal plan but will not switch
from their current meal plans next semester. "I'm pretty
much happy with the 20-meal plan," Golden said. "I rarely
miss meals, but I think having points would be good for
some situations."
"Personally, I'll stick with the 20-meal plan because it's
just simpler," Ash said. "I understand how a different class
schedule can make the 17-meal plan more convenient."
"We're not losing anything by having another option,"
Student Events Adviser Carmen Barron 'O5 said. It's "just
another choice."
Many students are in favor of this new plan. "For me
personally, sometimes I get up and want to have breakfast,
other mornings I get up too late," Eileen Estes 'O2 said. "I
think it's a good idea. It's like a midpoint. Everybody loves

The most important aspect of this meal plan is the

increased flexibility of the point system. Students on this
plan with have the option of using their points at Kohlberg
Coffee Bar and at Essie Mae's Snack Bar. This will provide
students on the 17-meal plan with options not available to
those on the 20-meal plan.
When creating the new meal plan, Budish had athletes
in mind. "Most athletes eat breakfast at least a few days a

a compromise."

"Student Council realizes that this isn't the answer to
all of the problems that people have about meals," Budish
said. "Maybe, in the future, a meal plan under 14 will be
offered. This is a good first step, seeing as we haven't made
a change in five years."

Discussion is key
Across the country, college campuses have been heating up as pro-Israel and pro-Palestine groups have held

protest after protest and demonstration after demonstration. As we all know, Swarthmore is no stranger to rallies, but there's something different about these events.
The intense emotion and vitriol spewed by the opposing sides is apparent as extremist terms like "Nazi" and
"apartheid state" are flung back and forth. At the
University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, for example, proIsrael groups protested when students at a pro-Palestine
conference sold a book calling the Holocaust a myth.
In some cases, the passions have even bubbled over
into violence. Both sides have reported incidents of vandalism and death threats, and the son of a rabbi was
beaten last week at the University of California at

Berkeley.
It's nothing less than tragic that, as the violence spirals out of control in the Middle East with both sides
unwilling to back down, the same thing seems to be crop-

ping up in this hemisphere. Though protests and demonstrations are often good ways of getting information out
about a cause, it seems as though with every march or
peace vigil, emotions run higher and dialogues suffer.
Surely people at Swarthmore feel just as strongly on
every side of the issue, but they persevere in writing opeds for this and other papers, and it's common to overhear seemingly well-informed conversation about it in
Sharpies. Yes, we often feel like we "talk things out" too
much for our own good. Perhaps it's not necessary to
have a fireside chat every time the meal plan options
change, but Swatties' propensity for open discussion and
idea exchange is to be commended in this case.

Let silence be a choice
The National Day of Silence, and those who took part
in it yesterday, protested "the silence faced by victims of
hate crimes and their allies," according to the small, blue
cards participants carried. The action of those who
remained mute meant to echo "that silence which is
caused by harassment, prejudice and discrimination." In
other words, it was a protest against imposed silence
everywhere.
This goal made the bright orange signs alerting
passers-by to "silent zones"
areas marked off by blue
tape requesting that people "be silent in this area to
honor victims of hate crimes"
a serious mistake.
The decision to remain silent was, and must be, a conscious choice made by those who not only are against discrimination and hate crimes but also decided to spend
the day protesting through silence. But many, though
strongly opposed to hate crimes, did not make that
choice.
The so-called "silent zones" went a step too far.
Attempting to forcibly dictate the actions of others
to
render them mute without their consent
is precisely
what the National Day of Silence was supposed to stand
against. Because many of these zones were in major thoroughfares, people were expected to walk through and
keep quiet without ever deciding to observe the day of
silence. This put them in the unfair position of having to
choose between active participation or rude disruption.
A group of students in a visible area that non-protesters could see but avoid if they preferred might have
proven more effective. Participants then could have
raised awareness without causing a sense of imposition.
The protest's cause was a good one, but we can only
hope it will be organized with more reflection in the
future.

Israel warrants
United States' aid
Dear Editor:
I was extremely disappointed by the gross misrepresentation of the current Israeli-Palestinian conflict by
Kent Basset, et al. in last week's oped. I have no objection
to Jews expressing their discontent with the Israeli government, but the authors' portrayal of the conflict is an
exaggeration that should be recognized by anyone.
Mr. Basset strongly suggests that the current violence
is solely provoked by the Israeli government through
overt aggression and that the Israeli government's
attempt to remove the Palestinian people from their
indigenous homeland is a form of modern-day imperialism. However, the disputed Gaza Strip is the indigenous
homeland of the Israeli people as well, and their population also has a right to inhabit the region. This is where
the conflict lies: Two religions whose principles directly
oppose each other claim the same region as their homeland. Each side wants to be the sole possessor of the area,
so each side uses overt force.
This has been occurring since Israel was created as a
nation-state, provoking the neighboring Arab governments to attack the new nation-state in hopes of destroying it, through a series of ultimately unsuccessful wars.
This is where the United States' alliance with Israel originates. By giving financial aid to the Israeli government,
the United States is not supporting the genocide of an
ethnic minority. It is continuing a political alliance that
developed from its desire to protect a fledgling nationstate surrounded by antagonistic governments.

Silence misinterpreted
Dear Editor:
Ironically, this school has silenced the voices of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered (LGBT) people and
their allies on the very same day the rest of the nation
was protesting the silence of such people.
Contrary to the message printed on cards given to
every student, the Day of Silence is "a national youth
movement protesting the silence faced by lesbian, gay,
bisexual and transgender people and their allies," as
www.dayofsilence.org clearly states. The reserved-students e-mail about the National Day of Silence misrepresented the day's purpose, saying it "generally commemorates LGBT community victims of hate crimes." LGBT
victims of hate crimes are only a small part of the day's
greater concern, which is the silence that all LGBT people and their allies face through discrimination and
abuse. Further, by imposing silence on others, be it
through the campus-wide silent period or the silent
zones, our school has committed the very acts which the
spirit of the Day of Silence protests.
In expanding the purpose of the day, we have lost
sight of the true purpose, the need of a day to protest
and reclaim the silence of (not commemorate hate
crime victims among) LGBT individuals and their
allies. Even if someone participated in the Day of
Silence in accord with its original purpose, his or her
voice was ostensibly lost, summarily assumed to be just
like all the other silent voices. Yesterday, through misrepresentation and (I can only hope) misinterpretation,
our college silenced LGBT people and their allies, stripping them of their only means of reclaiming the silence
they face every day.

The meaning of Abercrombie and Fitch
BY DANN NASEEMULLAH

AND NATHAN ASHBY-KUHLMAN

There have been many bizarre occurrences here on
this campus in recent weeks and years. The Sager Easter
Cabaret Passover weekend comes to mind, as does a rally
our freshman year that ended up being about the difference between cake and excrement. A highlight was a candlelit vigil on a freezing Saturday night in December
2000, held by so many football players, innocent in their
idealism that they could make a difference. There have
been many more instances in which our undying faith in
irony
alive and well in our hearts and minds
has
been affirmed.
When we hear the name "Abercrombie & Fitch," we
first look around for a couple of Princeton dormitories
(circa 1750) and then a couple of Princeton students (circa
2002) who would openly wear anything with a name that
pretentious. And when we hear those two names in the
same breath as our beloved, liberal, progressive,
crunchy-granola, hyper-academic, non-Princetonian college, we wonder whether the irony has gone a little bit

too far.

On one hand, there was little that couldn't be laughed
at. Skinny, tall models with a veneer of commercialized
attractiveness, sporting briefs and other child-sized
apparel, were rolling around in the grass in front of
Sharpies, oblivious to the heartfelt rally for the living
wage that was going on a mere hundred yards up the hill.
That these models didn't look at all like their frazzled,
sleep-deprived, out-of-shape and generally less attractive
Swarthmore counterparts was obvious, especially since
we tend not to throw around our cherished books in
flings of fancy. Most people on campus took this irony as
a source of amusement, much like the ironies we have
seen and enjoyed before. Some Swatties were a little
more active in their recognition: Kudos to the rugby and
Frisbee teams for their streak of impetuousness!
Most have been able to brush away that day, and yet a
certain smell lingers, a sickeningly sweet aroma much
like the perfume of a certain high-class New York courtesan. It is an alien odor, because A&F is alien to us. The
incident itself brings into sharp focus the conflict
Swarthmore has with itself: we like to define ourselves as
being different, but also interact with a wider, more

PHOENIX

overtly elitist world. It is a world where we compete for
specs with Yale and Princeton, a world in which
Abercrombie & Fitch is a household name.
The real issue at stake is from what source we receive
our direction, from inside ourselves or from the outside.
With the administration letting A&F shoot for its "magalogue" here, our lifestyle stands in contrast to theirs. As
you can see in video on A&F's Web site, their lifestyle
involves college-age girls virtually all blonde, athletic
and skimpily clad
playing beach volleyball in sunny
California, without (presumably) a care in the world.
It seems obvious that this is not Swarthmore, where
"the beach" is something you dream about sitting on
while sighing wistfully over Proust or orgo in the various
corners of McCabe. This is ironic especially because the
beach you dream about is just outside the front door!
When we sit together and talk, we do not generally discuss completely vacuous topics, but rather
more often
than not
issues of some real consequence. At least, that
is how we see ourselves in our world. But in the A&F
world, we are nothing more than geeks straight out of
"Revenge of the Nerds."

If we let the commercialization of the elite world
define ourselves, we lose much of our own definition as
Swarthmore, which is already threatened by the disconnect between the "real world" and ours. Here at this col-

lege, we have earned the right
through sweat and tears
to define ourselves. That self-definition is crucial if we
are to be a place of real ethical intelligence. Without it,
issues like the living wage disappear, because we are
judged on the ideal practices of this elite culture, not our
community.
The A&F incident is indeed a rather petty thing and
easy to shrug off, especially since there is nothing wrong
with wearing Abercrombie clothes at Swarthmore. But it
is indicative of our need to affirm our own values. The
"values" of the A&F world are not ours. We pride ourselves on being able or at least willing to understand the
viewpoints of different worlds. But we must draw a line
in the sand between understanding and submitting,

between Abercrombie's beach and ours.

Alienated in academia
I was walking through Parrish yesterday, and I saw a big
stack of Campus Report newspapers sitting by the mailroom.
"Groovy," I thought. "Finally, a conservative paper that isn't
about objectivism. Rugged individualism is fine and dandy, but
Ayn Rand was an evil woman. I'm tired of hearing about her."
Sadly, my joy with this new
publication was short-lived.
Campus Report's leading

article is about an Indiana
University law professor who
sent out messages on a school
e-mail account, calling for students and faculty to lobby
against a Bush judicial
appointment. The fellow who
wrote the article complains

that this was a violation of
Federal Election Commission
laws. All decent people loathe
reserved-students spam, but

can't we settle the problem

without bringing in the feds?
Besides, aren't conservatives

supposed to be against using
campaign finance laws to suppress speech? Other atrocities

DAVID HAENDLER

The Price of Liberty

the paper documents include a conservative school paper in
Oregon having trouble with budgeting pooh-bahs and an antiCastro professor failing to get tenure.
By far the best thing about Campus Report is its ads. An ad
for a seminar implores readers to "Join like-minded men and
women from around the country" and "Discover the ideas your
professors don't want you to hear." Another asks students to
help distribute a booklet about "Persecution of patriotic students and faculty by campus officials."
i
I have no doubt that liberal bias exists in academia, that college campuses are much more liberal than mainstream America
and that left-wing student groups do some questionable things.
But to move into the deep paranoia of Campus Report requires a
strange, conspiratorial mindset. "Persecution of patriotic students?" I can see it now: A squad of diversity police in rainbowcolored uniforms drag a battered young Bush voter into a cell,
his sensible blazer muddied and torn. "You'll never get me to
renounce Ronald Reagan," the young man gasps.
"Foolish conservative!" the grim-faced multicultural dean
cries, throwing a steaming cup of Fair Trade coffee into his captive's face. "Ve heff ways of making you talk! Ze Postmodernist
Reich shall last VUN THOUSAND YEARS!"
Campus Report isn't alone in its disdain for the ivory tower.
In National Review Online, an associate provost at Boston
University claimed that "any college administrator who dares
to publish non-conforming opinions of a conservative flavor
will sooner or later sit in a courtroom listening to an attorney
twist his words into a supposed confession of prejudice and bad
faith" and compared being a conservative in academia to being
an explorer on an island full of cannibals. Anyone who reads
conservative opinion journals will see plenty of denunciations
of the Marxist zealotry which has supposedly overtaken U.S.
colleges. Our country has a popular Republican president, 27
GOP governors, and broad social disdain for zany left-wing ideology, and these guys still seem to believe that they need to
carry cyanide-filled fake teeth so as not to be captured alive.
The most disheartening thing about this is the hypocrisy. A
large part of conservatism's appeal is its skepticism of the cult
of victimhood, recognizing that often those who complain
about their voices being silenced are just disgruntled about the
fact that nobody agrees with what they say. It's a strange and
unpleasant experience to watch a commentator rail against the
many negative effects of identity politics, agree with much of
what he has to say, and then see him bitterly complain about
the oppression his people face.
And even if there is an evil cabal of left-wing academics
monopolizing our colleges, weeping about its existence won't
do any good. Where are the demonstrations in favor of free
trade? When was the last time you heard about a pro-death
penalty candlelight vigil, or a campaign bringing attention to
the fact that whales are overrated? Nobody even burns the
Cuban flag, for crying out loud!
There are some limits to how much activism the right
should do. Nobody wants the College Republicans to start plastering obnoxious "Why Not?" stickers all over the place or tear
downtown D.C. to shreds protesting steel tariffs. But if thoughtful conservatives spent less time moping about bias and more
time articulating their beliefs, they could enrich the state of
campus politics
or at least make things livelier.

Defending Israel
Dear Editor:
Few people who spout opinions about Israel have ever set
foot on Israeli soil, met the people, or contemplated the value of
its existence as a sovereign nation. Having visited Israel twice
ihis year, and myself a Jewish refugee of the former Soviet
Union, I feel responsible to write this letter in defense of Israel
and the accusations made against it in the last issue.
The Holocaust is traditionally viewed as the catalyst for
the formation of the official state of Israel. Although there has
been a Jewish presence in the Middle East for thousands of
years (Jewish communities remained even after expulsion by
the Romans), the population surged at the end of World War
II as hundreds of thousands of misplaced survivors poured
into what was then British-controlled Palestine. Many ships
were turned away, and many who made it past the coast
guard died shortly after in the desert. Even more died in the
war for independence, when the five Arab countries surrounding Israel attacked it on its founding day.
In response to the claim that Israel is illegally occupying
rightfully Palestinian lands, the conflict's history must be considered. In the 19605, Syrian snipers, safely tucked away in the
Golan Heights, picked off farmers working their lands to the
point that farming equaled suicide. In 1966, the Egyptians
closed off Israel's main port and mobilized forces on the Israeli
border; Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Syria did the same. As
then-President Nasser of Egypt said, "Our basic goal is the
destruction of Israel." Unable to grow its own food and cut off
from water routes, Israel was forced to attack preemptively.
During what became known as the Six-Day War, Israel conquered much of the Sinai Peninsula, the Golan Heights and
other previously Arab territories. As a result, terrorist attacks
on Israel ceased and northern Israel could finally be farmed.
The next armed conflict took place on Yom Kippur, 1973,
when Syria and Egypt attacked on this Jewish fasting day.
The war lasted several months, ending when Israel signed
away almost all the land it had gained six years earlier.
Everything was returned except the Golan Heights and East
Jerusalem. In the treaty, Egypt demanded Israel take possession of the Gaza Strip.

It is difficult to navigate through the
truths and half-truths of this messy
conflict.
From then on, until 1993, Israel occupied the West Bank and
the Gaza Strip. As part of the Oslo Accords, Palestine would
gain gradual independence from Israel over several years. An
official government was organized with Yasser Arafat as its
elected leader. Israel trained and armed Palestinian police to
enforce their own laws. Funding was given to Palestinians to
build schools and housing. In a meeting with Arafat in 2000,
then-Prime Minister of Israel Ehud Barak, offered 95 percent of
the desired land to the Palestinians to build their own nation.
But Arafat walked out of the meeting, rejecting the offer. What
followed is now known as the Intifada of 2000, in which
Palestinian police use the very guns supplied by the Israelis to
shoot at both the Israeli army and civilians.
Since then, Ariel Sharon, a much more militant Israeli
leader, has been elected. Both sides have implemented harsher
tactics to achieve their goals. It is difficult to navigate through
the truths and half-truths of this messy conflict, and neither
side is without blood on its hands. But it is also important to
acknowledge that imperialism is less central to the conflict
than is the struggle of two religious groups vying to attain
access to the same land they claim as rightfully theirs.
Jewsbelong on at least part of that land. That right is theirs,
not only because of their history, but also because the United
Nations, and thus international law, granted it to them in 1948. It
is because of Israelis' right to live on that land, and the need for a
Jewish homeland, that Israel is valuable to the world.
Anti-Semitism, along with oppression ofall sorts, is still alive
and well today. A country in which any Jew is welcome alleviates
some of that danger. When Ethiopia in 1985 and 1992 issued ultimatums for all Jews to leave the country, who was willing to
absorb those immigrants immediately? When the Soviet Union,
where Jews were persecuted and executed for 70 years, finally
flung open its doors, what country accepted the millions of
refugees without questions?
The truth is that Israel needs to exist, but it continues to do
so in the harshest of environments. It is a speck of a country,
located in an environmentally and politically hostile desert. If
America were to withdraw its support from Israel, it would
almost certainly sign its death sentence, and once again Jews
would be without a home.

Israel's actions far from 'terror'
Dear Editor:
This letter seeks to provide some of the context surrounding the current Israeli-Palestinian conflict ignored
in Kent Basset's oped last week. Many want to reduce the
conflict to a simple case of who attacked whom or which
side is to blame. This simplification necessarily ignores
historical information essential to understanding the situation. We don't claim that Israel is the "good guy" in
every case, but we do contend that there is a clear difference between Israel's actions and terrorism.
Basset wrote, "Here's a brief history of that policy: In
the West
1967, Israel conquered Palestinian territory
Bank and the Gaza strip and has been dispossessing
the indigenous population, Palestinians, for the past 34
years." These few "facts" are not wholly correct. Even if
they were, they would not provide even a basis for understanding the current conflict. The '67 War was more of a
misunderstanding than a case of Israel "conquering."
Syrian and Soviet intelligence falsely got word that Israel
was planning an attack, so Syria and Egypt started
amassing troops on Israel's border. Once it was clear that
Syria and Egypt were going to attack, Israel launched a
preemptive strike. Even understanding the '67 War cannot provide the knowledge necessary to understand
today's events. One must take into account the '73 War,
Intifada and the Oslo peace process. Similarly, Bassett's
claims about illegally occupied territories and colonies
ignore relevant international law. United Nations
Resolution 242, for example, calls for Israel's return of
"territory," not "the territories," and only in exchange for
a secure peace with recognized boundaries.
Although the world seems to think anti-Semitism is
old hat, it still exists. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said,
"Anti-Semitism, the hatred of the Jewish people, has
been and remains a blot on the soul of mankind. In this
we are in full agreement. So know this also: Anti-Zionist
is inherently anti-Semitic, and ever will be so." That
interpretation is certainly up for debate, but it is true
that anti-Semitism still exists and motivates anti-Israel
activity. Israel was created because of anti-Semitism.
There have been several attacks on synagogues in Paris

and other

European

cities where people apparently

equate the State of Israel with Judaism. Jews in Europe
and Israel itself are still under constant attack. Given
this context, it should not seem surprising that Israelis,
living in a country the size of New Jersey, regard their
security as being of paramount importance.

Basset's article asserted that American media are

pro-Israel. Consider the following quotes by Benny
April

IX 2002

Morris, a radically leftist Israeli historian, writing in
the London Guardian Feb. L
"The intifada is a strange, sad sort of war, with the
underdog, who rejected peace, simultaneously in the
role of aggressor and, when the western TV cameras
are on, victim. The semi-occupier, with his giant but
largely useless army, merely responds, usually with
great restraint, given the moral and international political shackles under which he labours. And he loses on
CNN because F-16s bombing empty police buildings
appear far more savage than Palestinian suicide
bombers who take out 10 or 20 Israeli civilians at a go.
"Daily, Palestinian officials bewail Israeli 'massacres' and 'bombings' of Palestinian civilians when
in fact there have been no massacres and the bombings
have invariably been directed at empty PA buildings.
The only civilians deliberately targeted and killed in
by
large numbers, indeed massacred, are Israeli
Palestinian suicide bombers."
Morris's comments make it clear that Israeli forces,
unlike Palestinian suicide bombers, have not targeted
civilians. In this context, it is important to note that the
current Israeli strikes in Palestinian cities have brought
proof that the Palestinian Liberation Organization is
funding terrorism. Documents signed by Arafat were
found, providing for the funding of explosives used in
suicide attacks. It is for reasons like this that it is hard,
sincerity
if not impossible, for Israel to
when he states that he condemns terror.
We acknowledge that Israel's actions have been
imperfect. We call upon Israel to make real sacrifices
for peace. We share this view with Israelis, most of
whom support a land for peace formula based on 1967
boundaries. Criticizing Israel is OK, and we do it also,
but to pick and choose your facts in order to portray
Israel in a bad light does not promote the achievement
of a realistic peace.
It is very easy to blame either side. Those who wish
to work for peace should seek a fully informed understanding of the situation, including the motivations of
each side. After doing this, we strongly believe that
Israel is justified in defending itself and, while we don't
always agree with its methods, we feel that it is impossible to compare Israeli defense techniques and
Palestinian terror.

transplanted organist for concert
BY CARLA GREENBERG

cgreenbl@swarthmore.edu
At the tender age of 17, Patrick Kabanda began making a living as
a lounge pianist at the Sheraton Hotel in his hometown of Kampala,
Uganda. In 1996, at the age of 21, Kabanda received a scholarship to
study organ at Brevard College in North Carolina.
Thus began Kabanda's North American odyssey. In a few days, he
will perform with the college orchestra.
Under the direction of new conductor Daniel Wachs, the
Swarthmore CoUege Orchestra will perform in a concert featuring
Leaya Lee 'O2 on violin in Pablo de Sarasate's "Gypsy Airs" and
Kabanda on the organ in Camille Saint-Saens' "Symphony No. 3 in C
minor, Op. 78 ('Organ')." The concert, on Saturday at 8 p.m. and

Sunday at 7 p.m., will also include the suite from George Bizet's

"Carmen."
Kabanda began his musical career as a choirboy at Namirembe
Catherdreal, where he taught himself to play both the piano and the
organ. While playing at the Sheraton, he also taught private piano lessons. In 1998, Kabanda transferred from Brevard College to The
Juilliard School, and in 2000 he received a summer grant from the
school to teach and perform in Uganda and Kenya.
Wachs met Kabanda at Juilliard, where Kabanda is currently in

piece just had to be performed here."

his first year of the Masters Program. Wachs, himself pursuing a second Masters degree at Juilliard in orchestral conducting, has been
involved with the college orchestra since last spring, when he was a
substitute for former conductor Sarah loannides.
This year he is the full-time conductor for the college orchestra, a
job he describes as "a way to get away from [New York] city and do
something that he really loves." As for working at Swarthmore,
Wachs says "the thing about Swarthmore is you all are so brainy.
Everyone is so unbelievably smart
it makes it so much easier."
The reason Wachs has brought Kabanda to Swarthmore is that
when he "first walked into the Lang Music Hall, I saw the organ and
thought that this piece ['Organ'] just had to be performed here."
According to Wachs, not many concert halls have permanent organs,
making Lang an ideal place for performing the piece. As for how he
chose Kabanda, "Let's face it. How many organists from Uganda are
there?"
The process of working with Kabanda has been "hairy."
"When he's sitting up there, he has to look in a rear view mirror,
literally." Because of the way the organ is situated in the hall, the
organist must sit with his back to the orchestra and the conductor,
and look into a rear view mirror to observe what is going on. "We also
had the organ break down [during the] last rehearsal," Wachs says.
All in all, though, Wachs seems very happy with the orchestra's
work this semester. "The orchestra has worked very, very hard. It's a
challenging piece. They've

been real troopers."

Russian playwright's 'I Want a Baby' depicts grim battle for the body
BY MATTHEW FITTING
mfittinl@swarthmore.edu

A body drops, and "I Want a Baby" begins.
Considering what follows, it seems the perfect opening.
In 1926 Russia, the play's setting, "the houses are groaning
with exhaustion"; those living inside are cramped, consumed with drink, death or lovemaking, and sometimes all
three. There is barely room to breathe, and by the end it
almost makes sense: Why wouldn't a body jump, rather
than spend another minute trapped inside?
Written by Sergei Tretyakov, a little-known Russian
playwright disliked and eventually silenced by the
Stalinist Soviet Union, the play's main themes are sex,
eugenics and gender battles. But along the way it offers a
portrait of the pre-World War II Soviet Union that leaves

little hope.
THE PHOENIX

The play is presented by students in Acting 111 and
Advanced Design, more commonly known as Junior

Company.
As theatre professor and "Baby" director Ulla
Neurenberg-Denzer said, this is "a society that has a big
ideal, but the reality just isn't that great," a place where
unexpected, unwanted elements, such as hooliganism, are
constantly plaguing the Communist ideal.
"They're past the hunger phase, but basically everything is trying to organize itself," Denzer said.
As the story follows Milda (Felicia Leicht 'O4), making
regular stops to explore common period scenes like gang
rape, the play presents a battle for the body that involves
nearly every female character's desire to procreate. Even
Milda eventually feels the reproductive urge, though she is
a character who presents her life philosophy near the
play's start this way: "I love it when there's turbines on

A devoted Communist, her main project at outset is to

make the local salon (club) into a nursery where mothers
can take their children to be properly cared for and raised.

Soon, though, her interest turns to Yakov (Petar Lazarevic
a workman and "100 percent proletarian" from whom
Milda wants, as she tells him, above all and only one thing:
"your sperm."
The set is dominated by a central, metallic structure, as
tall as the Pearson-Hall Theatre's balcony sections, that
serves as an apartment building. When all the play's players are crammed inside, it's an ingenious way of portraying the tight quarters of the time. Denzer said this reflects
another of the play's most important themes: lack

'Y Tu Mamá También': Your mother would not approve
High-grossing film impresses reviewer, documents growing pains of adolescents and the country they live in
BY KATHLEEN O'HARA
koharal@swarthmore.edu

The first thing to know about "Y Tu Mama Tambien" is
that its sexual implication is just as present in Spanish as it
is in English. "Y Tu Mama Tambien," translated to imply
"And (I Fucked) Your Mother, Too," is a fascinating, frenzied
trip through Mexico via two hormone-laden adolescents and
an enigmatic Spanish cousin. Part teenage road movie, part
social drama, "Y Tu Mama" marks director Alfonso
Cuaron's homecoming after more than a decade in
Hollywood. Although his English-language films ("A Little
Princess," "Great Expectations") received modest acclaim
here, "Y Tu Mama" quickly establishes itself as wonderfully
separate from Cuaron's previous work.

Courtesy

Producciones Anhelo

The film opens on friends Julio (Gael Garcia Bernal) and
Tenoch (Diego Luna), preparing for a summer of mindless
hedonism before beginning university in the fall. Julio
Zapata (yep, it's a reference to that Zapata) lives with his single, perpetually working mother; Tenoch Inturbide (same
surname as a long-ago Mexican emperor) is the privileged
son of a corrupt government official. Though manifestations
of class disparity eventually punctuate their relationship,
the boys' distant social standings don't infringe on their
daily cycle of parties, pot and commentary on other people's
girlfriends (high points include "She's a total prime babe,"

and "Left-wing chicks are cool, dude!").
If the first minutes of the film utterly repulse you, hold
on. The boys are masters of obscene humor, yet even when
they move toward the purely offensive, Cuaron depicts them
in such a way that the larger joke is on them. The camera
captures character-generated, anecdotal hilarity, but the
sensitive script (composed by Cuaron and his brother
Carlos) weaves these moments into an insightfully understated tale of the painfully funny coming-of-age process.
Mexico's own growing pains parallel this personal coming of age; the film quietly contemplates the issue of national identity in the face of globalization as the boys Undertake
a cross-country trip. The journey begins as a dubious

attempt to seduce the exquisite Luis Cortes (Maribel Verdu),
the 28-year-old wife ofTenoch's cousin. When the boys accost
her at a family wedding and learn she has recently arrived
from Spain, they offer to take her to a beautiful Mexican
beach, the non-existent Boca de Cielo (Heaven's Mouth).
Luisa is initially noncommittal, but, after receiving news of
her husband's infidelity, she surprises the boys by asking to
go.
During the journey, scene after scene in a dilapidated station wagon captivate us because of the characters inside.
Cuaron has rightfully invested much in his three actors, all
of whom lend depth and credibility to roles that could easily
turn hackneyed. The boys are alternately officious and
oafishly sensitive, their easy camaraderie onscreen reflecting a lifelong friendship off-screen. Maribel Verdu plays
their object of desire with a clever wit and fine sense of perception; as Luisa, she handles the boys with a generous and
amusing grace. Long-limbed and gaunt-faced, she moves
from gorgeously sensual to strangely miserable in a matter
of seconds.
A fourth and equally important character is the country
itself. Cuaron intermittently employs a disembodied thirdperson narrator to call attention to the Mexico that escapes
Julio and Tenoch's manic antics; while this narration borders on self-indulgent, it serves to illuminate both Mexico's
social landscape and the characters' distinct relations to it.
Emmanuel Lubezki's exceptional cinematography does a
parallel routine, wandering from the trio to some very articulate shots of the unperceived Mexico. The bloody body of a
day laborer is captured on the side of a congested highway;
at a society wedding, the newlyweds are overlooked in favor

of the bastion of bodyguards munching hors d'ceuvres in

the parking lot.
It's worth attending to whom and what the camera captures when it strays from the central characters, especially
because, when they are on screen, the attention is on more
basic pursuits. As the title suggests, sex figures largely
into "Y Tu Mama." It's nearly omnipresent in the dialogue,
and shots of tangled bodies in various states of undress dominate screen time. Every few minutes, there's a quick interlude of some kind raunchy activity, and I emphasize the

quick. Whether the graphic on-screen sex is appealing or disturbing, it's difficult not to appreciate Cuaron's candid
depiction of teenage boys in action. It's awkward, amusing
and fast.

While some tickets were surely sold on the sex scenes
alone, the film's enormous success in Mexico demonstrates
an admirable response from national audiences. "Y Tu
Mama Tambien" is the highest grossing domestic picture in
Mexican film history, despite an initial admissions ban for
viewers under the age of 18 (it was revoked after teenagers
surrounded several theaters with picket lines). Underneath
all the humor, sex and general teenage mayhem, this film
subtly presents sociopolitical questions vital to a country
moving toward a mature identity. Cuaron was smart to head
home for this piece; I only hope he stays there and finds continued inspiration in a nation and growing film industry
that will journey to places Hollywood will not.

When Milda and Yakov finally set down to consummate their relationship/agreement, nearly the entire building is able to listen in,

Adding to the constant feeling of crowd and clutter, "Baby"
often employs dummies: as dance partners, rape victims. The
move adds meaning to each of the play's themes at different
points.

Denzer said she thinks that all those themes are still extremely
salient now.
"Eugenics are sort of an issue that comes back today," she said.
"Today we have sperm banks. There a lot of other children conceived through an other-than-natural process." Also, she added,
"The cast could relate to the body, to the physical concerns" of the
characters, concerns that raise one of the most pertinent questions
to present-day debates on abortion and other issues: To whom does
the body belong?

Scrabble success for Suzanne
Suzanne Wu is a cocky, immature, chain-smoking, barely coherent bitch who doesn't think you can beat her at
your own game. If you don't mind getting your ass beat
down and then living with the subsequent embarrassment,
challenge her by writing to phoenix@swarthmore.edu.
I can just imagine what my mother would say about
English literature professor Peter Schmidt: "Oh, Suzanne,

Professor Schmidt so hands-some, full head of hair. And
such big vocabulary. Maybe you lose challenge so he like
you more, eh? No one like the smart ass. What I name you?
Modesty: modesty very beautiful name."
Except my mother isn't some Amy Tan stereotype with
predictable self-sacrificial opinions told in an exaggerated
accent and cadence (even though I did have to play a
stringed instrument). My mother is ten times smarter than
me, Radcliffe-educated, manic-depressive, self-absorbed and
prone to fits of melodramaticbitterness that tenuously tread
the line between vitriolic irrationality and painful, incisive,
beautiful understanding. "Kick his ass," is what my mother
actually said.
So I must admit that this challenge was a little bit different than the others, given my desire to actually win and not
just not embarrass myself too badly. I've been playing the
and believe you me, Scrabble is intense
game intensely
for about the last six months, or at least since the last
anniversary of the Columbine shooting.
You see, due to some confusion over the ownership of a
BB gun, my little brother found himself under both suspension and house arrest the week of the anniversary of
Columbine. Not only was he cooped in a house with no cable,
but during this time he was also not allowed to make or
receive phone calls. So all he did was play Scrabble online
and tell my parents that this qualified as studying for the
SATs. He got pretty ridiculously good.
My little brother. He would call me up and con me into
playing games where I started with a 200-point lead, and I
would lose horribly. And so, of course, I started playing
more, trying to get good enough so that I might actually be
able to compete with him. He has since lost to me (I got
lucky, he says), and lost interest in the game (he got a driver's license). I, meanwhile, have embraced geekiness full-

heartedly.
So too, it would seem, did Professor Schmidt, somewhere
along the way. He wears Ray-Bans with coke bottle-thick
lenses and describes his college self at Oberlin as a "nerd,
happy to finally be among nerds." Schmidt, however, didn't
play Scrabble much until he got married, and even then only
sporadically.
Peter and I start the game with a little pre-game ritual of
mine: Both players must pick an adjective beginning with
the same letter as the other player's name to write on the
scorecard. He picks "sibylline," and I, uh, don't know how to
spell that. I also have no idea what it means. Peter explains
that "sibyl" means a female prophet or fortuneteller. What a
great word. I can't top it, and my mind blanks now that it's
my turn to think of an adjective. The only two I can think of
beginning with a "p" are "perpendicular" and "pious." So I go
with "pious."
We draw tiles to see who goes first, and he draws an "n"
and I pull a "v." Peter draws tiles and lays down the word
SITAR on the center square, worth 12 points. I know this
sounds snobby, but I am immediately much more relaxed.
One should never play the "s" unless it nets you at least 20
points. Ha.
I capitalize on this wrong move by playing "ooze" off the
"s" for OOZES. The Peter sets me up again, using another "s"
to play FARMS off of the 'a" in "sitar" for 15 points. By now
it's apparent that, even though he may outsmart me ten-toone, I clearly have more Scrabble knowledge. The "s" he
plays in "farms" sits right next to the triple-word line, and,
as luck would have it, I have an "hj" to form the word SH,
which I then play down from "hj" to make the word HAPPY
with a blank tile serving as the second "p." This nets me 44
points. The score is now 72-27, in my favor (so much for modesty). This remains more or less the margin the entire game,
except for a turn when Peter plays FOXING, when the gap
briefly narrows, and for a string of turns after he pulls the
"q" and can't get rid of it. Meanwhile, I keep racking up
points with cheap little words, like in one turn when I play
the word NET on top of "foxing" to also form NOR, EX and
TI.
The "q" is killing him. Every turn Peter has these brief
flashes of hope where he sees a high-scoring word that can
almost do with the 10-point "q." Every turn, instead of just

dumping it, he resigns himself to playing a wordwith singledigit pointage and waiting for another chance.
"If only we could play more drugs," he sighs. Uh, OK. I
have no idea what he's talking about. I can hear my caricatured mom already: "Stay away from that man, Suzanne,
he's a ba-ad influence."
"I keep seeing words that aren't really words, but sound
like they should be," he explains. "Words that are combinations of sounds that have certain associations, like 'Zoloft.'
I laugh, relieved.
Finally we get down to the last few tiles, and he still hasn't put down the "q." A few moves back, he had one particularly lengthy turn, where he stared sadly at a corner where
I had, by chance, blocked him from playing the word "quilting," which would have used all his tiles and scored him an
extra 50 points.
"You have a conspiracy going with Modern Languages,
don't you?" he says, a man reduced to wild accusations in
frustration.
"Yeah, there's someone sitting over there in Kohlberg
with a telescope, looking into this window at your tiles and

reading them to me," I admit.

The game ends without much fanfare. He never plays the
"q." And I almost feel sort of bad for winning, because he
takes it so well. Then Peter reveals a rule of his own, one he
had alluded to earlier but waited to tell me until the game
was over.

"Whoever wins has to make a poem out of the words
used," he says. Suddenly, I wish I had lost. Poetry is not my
forte, and back in high school when I realized that my
depressed rantings were just as bad as everybody else's, I
swore it off. So instead I wrote a rap, at which my skills are
arguably even worse than poetry writing. Here goes:
AH, I'm DAZED/ I'm in a DAZE/ I'm BOOZEing, but I'm
STRAIT/1 SPENT my VIM on BEER/1 SPENT my GRIT on
DJINN/ And I'm FOXING/I'm OGLEing /but BROADs don't

College looks to eliminate budget "extras'

bills, office supplies and equipment."
Most administrators have welcomed the cut as a way to
tighten up finances within the departments. "The feeling is
that the new budgets will be a little more honest," Gross said.
"This is making everyone a little more budget conscious," Associate Dean of Residential Life Myrt Westphal
said. "For example, people have certainly been more aware
of leftover food at events and conferences. This is certainly
one area in which we hope to cut back."
Westphal explained that there will not be as much money
available for basic dormitory improvements, including new
furniture, carpets, a stove or a lounge television set.
However, she does not anticipate this becoming too much of
a problem during the year. "The impact on student life won't
be super-noticeable," she said. "It's not a take-away situation

ing exposed and limited if unforeseen opportunities arise
during the year."
At first, Gross thought that food was the key to improving the budgetary situation. "I had a theory that most of our
money went to pizza," Gross said. "I had the idea that, if we
all went with plain pizza instead of ordering toppings, we
could save the right amount of money. Luckily, wiser heads
prevailed."
Among the biggest areas affected are food and health,
admissions, facilities and athletics. "The requested cut did
not apply to staffing in my department which includes academic, computing and the library," Connie Hungerford,
provost, said in an e-mail.
To meet the request, departments have decided to take a
closer look at items that will have the least impact on students. "We specifically were trying to avoid goring any program and do not believe that any department has been
harmed," Hungerford said. "I don't think students will be
aware of where the cuts have been made. They are likely to
be in the margins of expenditure categories such as phone

as much as it is a less-was-added situation."

said. "But we are working on adjusting the times of our contests so that we can limit travel to one day instead of facing

Gross cited reducing travel opportunities for the admis-

sions office as well as delaying publication of college pamphlets as ways he plans to save on costs during the next year.

Athletics director Bob Williams said his department has

been adjusting schedules to keep up with the budget
requests. "We cannot be expected to adjust our budgets to

the expenses of an overnight trip. This should save us a
great expense."
Additionally, the athletic department will have to adjust
purchasing. "Big ticket items in equipment supplies for various teams may have to be deferred," Williams said. "We can
do this without affecting the quality ofathletics."
In all likelihood, a few cultural organizations may also
face constraints. "It's very possible that the IC and the BCC
might have to cut or coordinate programs," Gross said. "One
can argue that these organizations are already over-programmed as it is, but they may need to work together more
to avoid an overlap of speakers and topics in order to save on
costs."

Bloom believes the cuts will help out the college's finan-

cial and organizational position in the long run. "I don't
think people will find any of them unacceptable but rather
see the approach as very responsible in terms of pruning
what we're doing in order to provide funds for current needs
and opportunities," he said.

Winless softball team aims for improvements
BY KATHRYN JANTZ

kjantzl@swarthmore.edu
With 17 losses, the Swarthmore women's softball team
is struggling. But it has nine games left
nine more

opportunities to improve its record.
Five are against conference teams: Muhlenberg,
Washington, Gettysburg, Franklin & Marshall and
Haverford. The team will have the home advantage at
three of these games.
Essentially a brand new team, the Garnet women are
over 50 percent first-years and have no seniors. Four juniors and sophomores provide the only upperclassmen guidance. The team looks toward a better finish this season.
"Today we played the defending [Centennial
Conference] champs, and we had a lot of clutch hitting and
some good defense, so it looks like we are picking up for
the season," Ariana Lindermayer 'O3 said. "Since we are
not losing any players, and we are getting our pitcher from
being abroad, we will be the team to beat [next year]."
The Garnet women have started to show potential
recently. The scores are getting closer, and the team is
working to improve offensively. After scoring few runs at
the beginning of the season, the players' bats are finally
coming alive. The women played a doubleheader against
Muhlenberg on Tuesday. Both games of the doubleheader
were losses, but, according to Felicia Carter 'O3, "This
game was really great, because it showed our hard work

opponents.

during practice paying off." The first game was a 10-1 loss,
and the nightcap was 9-3.
Earlier in the week, the Tide hosted Dickinson in another conference doubleheader last Saturday. The first game
started slowly, with the Red Devils 5-0 up until the fifth. In
the fifth inning, however, the Garnet really started to fight
back. With one out, Sam Brody 'O5 hit a double to left. Kat
Athanasiades 'O5 drove Brody home with an RBI double to
center. Mary Mintel 'O5 moved to base after being hit with a
pitch. Maryann Chambers 'O4 scored Athanasiades with a
two-out single, and Lindermayer hit a single into right field
that sent Mintel home. That offensive burst unfortunately
wasn't enough, as the Tide fell 6-3.
Once again, the second game was a slow start until K.C.
Reed 'O5 hit a home run in the fifth inning. Mintel scored
the final run of the nightcap, but the Garnet couldn't keep
up with Dickinson's offense, losing 10-2.
The team's weak batting average of 170 has kept the
Garnet out of most of the games they've played to date.
Gettysburg, the top team in the conference, has a batting
average of .319.
When the Garnet do get base hits, they almost never get
extra bases. They have only seven doubles, one triple and
two home runs as a team for the season. This is compared
to the 33 doubles, eight triples and eight home runs their
opponents have hit against them. Fielding has also been a
problem for the Garnet, as they have committed 49 errors
this year alone, far outnumbering the 14 errors of their

"Hitting has been our major problem for the last few
years, but we are definitely improving. As soon as we
improved, our fielding has been lacking," Lavallee said.
"So we just have to get both of those going at the same
time. We are definitely happier with how we have played
than before. We just need to get our talent from practice to
carry over into the game situation."
Lavallee is one of the bright spots for the Garnet Tide.
She holds the highest batting average and is the only member of the Tide with 10 or more hits, though Athanasiades
is near her offensive pace.

One of the obstacles the Garnet women must overcome

is the superior pitching they face in the league. Although
this season has been rough, the future bodes well. The top
pitchers of the team, Chambers and Val Marone 'O5, have
two or three more years to improve their game and to
make the team stronger. Although the team is not near the
top in the conference, it is still a step above high school,
according to Mintel. "We just practice harder," she said.
During practice, Mintel said, individuals have the
opportunity to work on skills particular to each player. For
the first-years, this is a year for them to adjust to college.
Right now, a berth in the conference championships is
extremely far off, but the young team still has the potential

to improve.

The Tide's next opportunity to improve comes Saturday
at 1 p.m, when the team hosts Gettysburg.

Women's track narrowly
falls to Johns Hopkins
Cold weather hurts results, causes cramps
BY DERRICK WU

Battling cold temperatures and brief snow flurries, the Tide received quite a scare on
Saturday when its star athlete Imo Akpan 02 hobbled off the track with cramps in her
;

Swarthmore and Johns Hopkins 800-meter runners burst off the starting line Saturday.

Despite individual results,
men's track can't manage win
BY DERRICK WU

dwul@swarthmore.edu

Despite an impressive effort from the
hurdlers and hurlers, the young men's
track team fell to Johns Hopkins on
Saturday, 83-49. Kwaku Ntoso 'O3 notched
wins in both the 110-meter and 400-meter
hurdles, and Rob Melick 'O3, Justin Paglieli
'O2 and Randy Keim 'O2 gave the Tide a first
place sweep in the shot put, discus and
javelin respectively.
"We're still in the heart of the training
process," Ntoso said. He finished third in
the conference last year in the 110-meter
hurdles. "We're still trying to develop. It's
just a matter of training hard."
"We're a very young team," added Kier
Wachterhauser 'O4, who placed second in
the 400-meter dash. "Along with Kwaku,
I'm one of the oldest people on the team."
The team also missed the presence of

hurdler Matt Williams 'O4, who was unable
to compete due to illness. "Matt has
improved a real lot," Ntoso said. "He push-

es me and makes it fun in practice."
The Tide has the most potential in distance events, where it boasts an impressive
group of talented first-years. "By the time
I'm a senior, the distance runners will be
really good," Wachterhauser said. Distance
runner Garrett Ash 'O5 placed second in the
1500-meter run, and James Golden 'O5
placed third in the 800-meter run.
First-year sprinter and jumper Jason
Perini 'O5 has also improved remarkably
over the semester. Perini won the triple
jump, finished second in the 100 and had
the fastest split (54.4) in the 4x400-meter
"Jason's getting really good,"
Wachterhauser said.
"The team's been diversifying as people
have been picking up new events," Perini
said. "I haven't run the 400 since high
school, and I've never tried the triple jump."
"Right now, we're focusing on individual performances, since winning as a team
isn't an option," Wachterhauser said.
"Hopefully, we'll be able to look at it as

relay.

right leg.
"It's tough running in the cold weather," said Claire Hoverman 'O3, who captured the
1500-meter run. "We try to stay warm and run the race as quickly as possible."
Akpan, who was named 2002 Div. 11l Indoor Track and Field Athlete of the Year, was a
triple winner against Johns Hopkins University (JHU) on Saturday, finishing first in all
three events she competed in, the 400-meter dash, the 100-meter dash and the 4x400-meter
relay.
"I was getting cramped up in the cold weather," Akpan said. "My leg is still pretty sore,
but I think I should be able to run next Saturday."
In any case, Akpan would not let leg cramps ruin her final track season. "After graduation, I'll buy a treadmill. Right now, I want to see how far I can go," Akpan said. "I'll
work as hard as possible, until I'm out of time or resources."
The sky appears to be the limit for Akpan, who set a conference record last semester
by capturing six gold medals at the Centennial Conference Indoor Track Championships.
"Everybody on the team laughs when Imo runs, because it looks like everyone else on the
track is standing still," pole vaulter Catherine Clark 'O4 said.
Besides amassing a large collection of accolades, Akpan has received a congratulatory
message from Dean Bob Gross '62 and has been photographed for Sports Illustrated's
upcoming issue. "The response has been much more than I expected," Akpan said. "It
feels a little weird, but I'm happy that track is getting recognition."
"Imo is amazing," 800-meter run winner Elizabeth Gardner 'O5 said.
Akpan's accomplishments are even more impressive considering that she did not run
competitively until she arrived at Swarthmore four years ago. Two weeks ago, Akpan ran
the 800-meter for the first time in her life; currently, she holds the second fastest 800-meter
split in the conference.
When asked how many golds she can capture, Akpan just shrugs and laughs. "It's
tough running events back-to-back," said Akpan, "but I really want to win individually
and as a team."

First win for men's rugby

Celebrate Writing
at Swarthmore

BY BRETT KLUKAN
bklukanl@swarthmore.edu
The Swarthmore Evil Buzzards men's rugby club tallied their first win on Saturday, edging Ursinus 10-6. With an unruly Ursinus crowd and a short, narrow field, the Buzzards
relied on the forwards to move the baU up field and on the backs to play physically.
The game opened with the Evil Buzzards recieving the kickoff. A return by forward Ed
Sheldon 'O4 moved the ball well into enemy territory. Facing a strong defense, the Buzzards
inched towards the try zone. Ten minutes into the first half, lock Randy Goldstein 'O5
received a quick pass from scrumhalfPablo Montagnes 'O2 and barreled by three Ursinus
defenders to dive in for the try, putting the Buzzards ahead 5-0.
The rest of game was a back-and-forth battle between the two teams. Ursinus capitalized
on sloppy Swarthmore play to make two penalty kicks, giving the Bears a 6-5 lead. Things
looked grim for the Buzzards until the back line rallied with a series of commanding runs
by Axel Neff 'O2, Yasu Denda 'O2, Kenny Oh 'O4, Ted Chan 'O2 and Erik Munroe 'O4.
With five minutes remaining, Ursinus committed a penalty, giving Swarthmore a
chance to regain the lead. In a gutsy move, Montagnes decided to run the ball and make a
quick toss to flyhalf Jon Fombonne 'O5, who dove through the Ursinus defense and touched
the ball down in the try zone to put Swat ahead for good.
Ursinus's last-ditch attempts at a score were snuffed by the Swarthmore defense.
Brandon Carver 'O4 was key for the Evil Buzzards, as his consistent rucking and tackling
helped keep the ball in Swarthmore's possession. "In my two years of Swarthmore athletics, I've never beaten Ursinus. It feels so good to finally win," Carver said.

boost to morale and a crucial winning experience for the younger players. "I see a lot of
potential in the younger players. As they gain experience, the victories will come more easily," veteran hooker Manu Pradhan 'O3 said.
Those younger players have an excellent group of veterans to look to. Four-year veteran
fullback Kyung Lee 'O2 was an impermeable last line of defense andconsistently gained good
field position for the Buzzards. Brian Kasch 'O2 led the forwards with effective rucks and
quick-minded ball handling. The loss of these veterans next year will be unfortunate. The

Inconsistent play plagues
men's lacrosse's efforts
BY JUSTIN KANE

jkanel@swarthmore.edu

The story of the men's lacrosse team's season to date unfolded in the
zeniths and nadirs of Saturday's 12-5 loss to Dickinson.
The Garnet Tide played the first quarter half asleep, digging themselves a 4-0 hole as the offense sputtered repeatedly. But the second quarter witnessed a brilliant comeback, with three goals scored within the
first six minutes. The Red Devils were on their heels.
But just when a Garnet victory seemed as inevitable as the tide, the
Tide fell apart. Dickinson owned the second half not due to an advantage in ability but because the Garnet failed to maintain the intensity
they showed in the second quarter.
The Tide's schizophrenic play is as much a mystery to the team as it is
to onlookers. Captain Blake Atkins 'O2 said the team needs "to show much
more poise and patience on offense." Attacker and leading goal scorer Joe
DeSimone 'O4 said the Tide has "everything we need to become a very
competitive team; it's just a matter of putting all the pieces together."
All that is clear is that the Garnet Tide desperately need consistency.
Putting together a game against a conference opponent in which they do
not spend a quarter on vacation wouldbe a big step forward for this team.
Swarthmore has another shot at playing an even game Saturday at
Franklin Marshall. Beating the Diplomats, a team "solid on both ends
of the field," according to Atkins, will be no easy task.
The Garnet Tide must avoid the slow start that has plagued them in
recent games. "For some reason, we can never start the game running on
all cylinders and usually start playing well in the later quarters,"
DeSimone said. "We came back against Dickinson by playing like we
know how to." Against F&M, a squad that has challenged the top teams
in the conference, half-hearted play early in the game will quickly put
victory out of the Garnet's reach.
For Atkins, the keys to consistent play are reducing turnovers and playing more aggressively. "Our offense cannot afford to constantly turn the ball
over and expect our defense to cover for us; other teams are just too explosive," Atkins said. "We need to add aggressiveness to our hustle, so that we
dictate what other teams do, instead of waiting for something to happen."
Atkins realizes that if the Garnet Tide wait any longer, the season will
pass them by. Three games
all key conference matchups remain in
the season, Atkins's last. With the Tide's postseason future in the balance, Atkins plans to have the team ready to play.
"Obviously, we are underdogs against F&M and Washington College,
but win, lose or draw, we need to play the best we can play as a team,"
Atkins said. "That being said, losing to Haverford is not an option."

Pigout tournament, the women's
Ultimate Frisbee team faced stiff
competition at Penn State's Spring
Fling last weekend. Though the
Warmothers failed to place, they
won the tournament's Spirit
Award, given for bringing the most
sportsmanship and fun to the tournament on and off the field.
"The spirit of the game is one of
the most important things in

Frisbee," Marah Gotcsik 'O2 said.
"It recognizes how we conduct ourselves throughout the game and
that we're a fun team to play."
While having fun and being

the
Warmothers posted a 3-3 record at

Spring Fling. In three losses, the
squad badly missed Sara KatesChinoy 'O2, who was sidelined with
a dislocated shoulder. But the
Warmothers managed to battle
hard against elite competition.
In its first game, Swarthmore
lost to Haverford 11-6. The
Warmothers thenfell to a dominant
Michigan squad, which went on to
win the tournament. Swarthmore
balanced Saturday's losses with
two impressive victories over
Columbia (10-6) and Towson (8-6).
This weekend, the team will
travel to Yale for the Yale Cup.
Sectionals will take place the next
weekend, with Swarthmore hosting the first day of competition.
"Our section and our region are

years," Gotcsik said, "but we're
still hoping to do pretty well."

Earthworms capture Layout Pigout
tourney title, finish third at Penn St.
BY MARK JANOFF
mjanoffl@swarthmore.edu

"This is, without a doubt, hands down, the best
Ultimate team Swat has ever assembled,"
Earthworms tri-captain Brandon Silverman 'O2
said after the team finished first and third in consecutive tournaments.
Two weekends ago, the Earthworms dispatched
seven straight opponents, capturing Haverford's
Layout Pigout tournament title on the way. The
squad rode the crest into Penn State's Spring Fling
tournament last weekend, finishing third.
On the first day of Layout Pigout, the
Earthworms brutalized their opponents, outscoring them 52-17 in four games of play. On Sunday,
they squeaked by their two biggest regional rivals,
beating the University of Pennsylvania 14-12 in the
semifinalsand edging Penn State 13-11 in the finals.
With the wins, Swarthmore secured its first tour-

nament victory since winning the Frostbreaker
tournament two years ago.
"The most exciting part about the win was that
it was our regional rivals that we beat to get there,"
tri-captain Jeremy Slezak 'O2 said.
The Earthworms followed up the Layout Pigout
triumph with an equally impressive performance
at Spring Fling. The team extended its winning
streak to 12 games and knocked off two of the top 25
teams in the nation before losing to Cornell 15-4 in

the semifinals.

"I think we're really coming together as a team,"
Paul Wulfsberg 'O3 said. "Twelve in a row is probably the longest winning streak in Swat history."
The Earthworms had to win some tough battles
to set that record win streak. On Saturday, they
battled snow and wind throughout a hard-fought
15-11 win over Wesleyan. "Coming into the tournament, we knew that was going to be our biggest
game on Saturday," Slezak said.
After falling behind 8-6 in the first half, the
team boosted its defensive intensity and held
Wesleyan to three second-half points. "Our zone
defense was great," Silverman said. "Jeremy
[Slezak] had a couple of point blocks in the cup."
"Michael Wollenberg ['o2] had a couple of really

save points in the game," Wulfsberg
added.
The team also relied on a disciplined, methodical offensive attack in the win. "It seemed to be a
big D's to

and still
perfect balance of using the in-cuts
keeping them honest with effective long shots,"
Silverman said. Both Wulfsberg, a deep threat, and
...

Misha Horowitz 'O3, a hucker, were instrumental
in engineering Swarthmore's long shot attack,
Slezak added.
The squad concluded the play on Saturday with
decisive victories against Haverford (15-9) and
Johns Hopkins (13-9), and its 4-0 record on the day
earned the team a bye on Sunday.
The Earthworms took advantage of the bye,
sleeping for an additional two hours in preparation
for their game against 15th-ranked North Carolina
State. Swarthmore jumped out to a 7-2 lead in the
first half, capitalizing on several N.C. State
turnovers.
"We got off to a really great start," Slezak said.
"We were clicking on all cylinders and playing

tight defense." The team slipped in the second half
but maintained its advantage thanks to solid
defense by Horowitz and a balanced offensive
attack led by Slezak and Dan Schwartz 'O2. With
the 13-10 victory, the Earthworms set a team-record
12-game winning streak.
They could not carry their momentum into the
semifinal match against Cornell, which they
dropped 15-4. "I think we had exhausted the emotional high of beating N.C. State," Wulfsberg said.
The team also had only five or 10 minutes of rest
between the quarterfinal and semifinal games.
The Earthworms will travel to Yale this weekend to participate in the annual Yale Cup tournament, which features most of the best teams from
the East Coast. Sectionals are the following weekend, and the team likes its chances.
competition,"
"Only UPenn should be
Wulfsberg said. "As long as we play solidly, we'll at
least come in second and make it to regionals."
At regionals, the team will likely face stiff competition from UPenn, Penn State, Princeton and
Cornell. The top three teams at regionals qualify
for nationals.

To make playoff dreams reality, both
lacrosse teams must shake off slow start
Centennial Conference play hasn't been easy for both the men's and women's
lacrosse teams. Though the women rebounded from an 0-3 start in conference play
with a 15-5 victory over Dickinson Saturday, their playoff hopes hinge on the outcomes
of their final five conference games. The Garnet women need wins against Bryn Mawr,
Muhlenberg, Western Maryland, Ursinus and Haverford to secure a playoff berth.
The men's path to the playoffs is equally arduous, having dug themselves into an 0-3
hole. Despite expectations of victory against Dickinson, the Garnet Tide faltered in the
second half and lost 12-5 to the Red Devils. Now the Tide have three crucial games
remaining, including a daunting matchup with No. 4 Washington College, Saturday's
game at Franklin & Marshall and a grudge match against archrival Haverford.
For both teams, improved offensive play will likely be the key to victory. A successful run
to the playoffs for the men will depend on the play of Joseph DeSimone, pictured in
action against Dickinson above, and his fellow attackers. DeSimone, who leads the Tide
in goals scored, hasn't been able to find the net consistently since Centennial
Conference play began. For the women, playing tough defense has generated offense. In
the team's conference losses, the Garnet has given up an average of 15 goals. Against
Dickinson Saturday, defender Heather Kile, in action at left, helped anchor a backline
that didn't give up a goal in the first half and kept the ball under Garnet control.
