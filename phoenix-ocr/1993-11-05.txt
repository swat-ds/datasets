Fulbeck brings multicultural performance to Swarthmore
'Finding an identity is an ongoing process.
I redefine myself all the time....'
By Frank Kuo-Hui Yu
Writer, professor, and performance artist Kip Fulbeck presented
his "hapa" experiences to
Swarthmore students through a
multi-mediaperformance. Fulbeck
calls it "hapa" because it is a Hawaiian word meaning a person ofmixed
racial heritage with partial roots in
Asian and/or Pacific Islander ancestry. Fulbeck, whose father is of
English, Irish, and Welsh descent
and whose mother is Chinese, derives insights on racism, prejudices,
fetishes, sexism and stereotypes
from both sides of his heritage.
Whenasked how he identifies himself, he says, "Finding an identity is
an ongoing process. I redefine
myself all the time.... I consider

myself hapa."
He opened up his performance
by a seriesoflive readings. His live
readings are rhythmic monologues
that depict personal anecdotes.
Being an assistant professor in studio art at the University ofCalifornia at Santa Barbara, he creates vivid
images of his anecdotes and inner
feelings through dramatic changes
in tone, voice, and narrating speed.
Mike Maletic *94, a theater
major, describes Fulbeck's style as
being "casual and personal."
Maletic further says, "Fulbeck uses
personal stories to deal with larger
issues effectively."
Some ofthe topics ofFulbeck's
readings included questioning ethnic dating patterns, dispelling public images and stereotypes ofAsian
males, satirizing public's superfi-

rial understanding ofAsian culture,
and venting his anger toward
society'sprejudices towardbiracial
people. He concluded his monologue by showing disgust at
society's prejudice toward biracial
people: "I am tired people asking
me what I identify my self!...I am
tired to people telling me that I am
not real Chinese!.. .1 am tired offilling out ethnic boxes!...l am tired of
not being able to go home!"
The nonexistence ofhis metaphorical home in his last sentence
reminded his audience to question
how hapas fit into a country which
often ignores multi-raciality. Chris
Sunami, a student of African and
Asian heritage, remarks that he can
relate to many similar feelings they
share. He further says, "It's as if I
can see through his mind."
Fulbeck continued his performance with his award-winning
video "banana split & other mix
ups" after the intermission. The
video took first place at the 1991
Red River International Film &
Video Festival. It was also shown
on New York's WNET-TV as part
of the Independent Focus series.
Fulbeck intertwines photographs,
anecdotes, writings, monologues,
and sound effect in his video to
create a new form ofartwork. Juxtaposing the snapshot imagery with
the writings on the screen and his
rhythmic monologues, Fulbeck
documents a family life richly colored by the two cultures ofhis family. He conveyshismessage through
personal stories that are believable
and tangible to his audience.

very diverse crowd in which some
people of mixed or Asian heritage
can feel an immediate connection
with Fulbeck. Everyone got something out ofhis performance.

Survivors' week raises awareness
'Sexual assault affects everyone on campus, whether they know it or n0t....

By Eli Rubin
Survivors' Week, a week of
activities designed to help victims
of sexual assault cope and raise
awareness about the issue of sexual
assault, will come to a finale tonight
in the Cloisters during a candlelight
vigil.
Beginning Monday, theFriends
ofSurvivors and Survivors Support
Group has posted signs throughout
thecampus pertaining to the issue of
sexual assault. The groups have
occupied a table in Parrish Parlors,
offering yellow ribbons to show support and other information about
sexual assault, and have hosted a
movie night and a study break in
addition to the vigil scheduled for
tonight.
Possibly the most visible of the
group's actions this week has been
the appearance of the signs. Some
are designed to emphasize that many
students are survivors and every student has met a survivor. Others take
on a more serious tone, and are designed to express thepain withwhich
a survivor must deal.
Co-Coordinator of the spon-

soring groups Suzannah Cole '94
elaborated on the goals of Survivors' Week, including the purpose
of the signs. "The goals vary from
sign to sign. Many of them are to
showhow widespread survivors are,
others emphasize the pain of sexual
assault. They let the campus deal
with for a week what we deal with
for a lifetime."
Cole was disappointed at the
reaction to some of the signs. "It's
a difficult week for all survivors
and perpetuators, but what makes it
worse is when people tear the signs
down. That hurts." Othermembers
added similar sentiments.
Continuing, Coleexplained the
tying of yellow ribbons. 'Tying
yellow ribbons for Survivors' Week
is a tradition. The color yellow is
often used to commemorate survivors'issues ofany type. Itis important that everyone wear one, for
sexual assault affects everyone on
campus, whether they know it or
not, whether directly or indirectly."
Tuesday night, the Survivors
Group showed The Prince ofTides,
which was followed by "a discussion among a small group of

people," according to Cole.
Wednesday night, the group hosted
a study break in Tarble.
Thursday night, a Sexual Assault Policy meeting was held. The
main issues discussed were how to
remove inconsistencies in the
schools sexual assault policy, deal
withrevising punishments, and help
survivors to feel more comfortable
in the College environment.
Regarding the candlelight vigil,
to be held tonight at 7:30 p.m. in the
Cloisters, Cole stated, "The vigil is
to raise awareness, and to make
survivors feel more comfortable,
and it is a beautiful way to do it.
We're going to light the candles
then walk around campus, when
we come back, we're going to stand
in silenceuntil someone has something they want to say related to
sexual assault, or a poem whichhas
recently inspired them, or a song, or
anything related to the issue."
Speaking about the week in
general, Cole said, "I think the message is coming across. Other survivors have told me it has been more
successful than last year's Survivors' Week."

Tuesday's Borough Council election. Kuperberg won a seat on
the Council. In what he described as "the first E-Mail Acceptance
Speech in U.S. History," Kuperberg was brief and to the point.
"Thank you for your support" was the full text of his speech, which
was sent to Swarthmore faculty and staff.

Noted conservative advocate
Phyllis Schlafly was brought to
campus by theConservativeUnion.
The talk was sponsored by the
President's Office and Young
America's, a private foundation
founded by a Swarthmore alumnus to bring conservative speakers
to college campuses.
Schlafly's speech, entitled

"The Truth About Feminism,"
packed thePearson-HallTheatre in
the Lang Performing Arts Center.
Her talk focused on the history of
themodemfeminist movementand
what she considered its flaws and
inconsistencies.
An impromptu fire alarm interrupted the event but Schlafly
quickly got back on track. The talk

was followed by a question and
answer session and then, finally, a

reception.
Of the talk and her reception
at Swarthmore, Schafly had the
following to say: "[lt was] a lot of

Ongoing College Concerns
In an e-mail message earlier this week
President Bloom updated the community on
theprogress the college was making in its reinvestment decision.
Bloom said he was pleased with the
response he received from the community
and that both the concerns and the support
expressed wouldbe takeninto consideration.
"...subject to further comments from the community, I plan to recommend to the Investment Committee of tiio Board of Managers
that we lift constraints on our investment
advisers regarding investing in companies
that do business in South Africa; however,
that at the same time we continue to monitor
the situation and keep our reserve intact, so
that we would be in a position to suspend
further reinvestment at a future point, if we
feel morally obliged to do so. I believe this
strategy both expresses the sense of the community and responds with appropriate bal-

ance to the complexities of the present situation."
And, in another updated story, President
Bloom talked to The Phoenix about the current developments with the electronic mail.
A computer ethics statement is being prepared to answer the recent problems. The
faculty will have to discuss itand then student
input will be asked.
According to Bloom, "Once finalized
and approved by the faculty, the statement
should play an important role in articulating
our mutual obligations to protect and make
responsible use of this vital community resource. It is also the case that the Student
Codeof Conduct, which is being discussed by
students and faculty, will make it clear that
the use of the computer system for harassment and intimidation is as unacceptable as
any other form of harassment and intimidation."

Compiled from a news release from
Brian D'Agostino
On October 27, Constance L. Benson
served a new round of papers in her lawsuit
against ColumbiaUniversity andUnionTheological Seminary, giving them until midNovember to reply before the Court begins
its preliminary deliberations. Benson brought
litigation this summer against both institutions on grounds that they failed her controversialPh.D. dissertation on Ernst Troeltsch
(1865-1923) for arbitrary and capricious reasons. Troeltsch, an eminent German academic and a father of modem Protestant
ethics, is best known for applying sociological methods to the study of the history of
Christianity.
Benson's research presents Troeltsch as
an apologist for the power structure of Imperial Germany. According to Benson, Troeltsch
endorsed the work of Paul de Lagarde, a
notorious racist and anti-Semite who called
for the exterminationof the Jews two generations before Hitler. She also argues that
Troeltsch endorsed racist theories that legitimized European colonization of Africa, and
thathe supported suchpolicies at a time when
they were being questioned in Germany.
The attack on Benson's research was led
by Professor DavidLotz ofUnion Theological Seminary and Professor Fritz Stem of
Columbia. Stem is an eminent historian and
has served as Provost of Columbia, a rank
second only to President. Benson's lawsuit
claims that both Lotz and Stern had conflicts
of interest regarding her research. Lotz is a
Lutheran minister and an expert in the school
ofProtestant theology that includes Troeltsch.
Stem has close ties to the Niebuhr family,
which promoted Troeltsch's ideas in the English speaking world. Columbia denies that
these associations affected the evaluation of
Benson's dissertation, which the University
claims was lacking in academic merit.
Twenty outside experts have submitted
letters and affidavits in support of Benson's

case. These include Cornel West, the eminentphilosopher and theologian who directs
Princeton'sAfro-American Studies Program.
West is supporting the publication of
Benson's manuscript, which he calls "the
most significant critique of Troeltsch's politics we have—a critique that challenges the
Troeltsch so many of us had come to admire
and cherish."
ProfessorDavid Noble ofYorkUniversity, Ontario, and Leonard Minsky believe
Benson's case fits a disturbing trend in which
universities in the U.S. are suppressing academically meritorious research that is not
"politically correct." Noble is a co-founder
and Minsky is Executive Director of the
Washington-based National Coalition for
Universities in the Public Interest.
David M. Slater, Benson's lawyer, is
outraged by what he regards as Columbia's
callous attempt to destroy Benson professionally after all the personal and financial
sacrifices she made on behalf of her academic career. He has built a case arguing
that Columbia violated its own procedural
rules, including formation ofBenson's committee withsix rather than five members and
failing the dissertation on the basis of a tie
vote, both of which Slater claims were arbitrary and unprecedented.
Benson's dissertation could not have
been failed in good faith, Slater claims, since
less than one percent of dissertations are
ever failed in oral defenses and Columbia
had just distinguished the dissertation with
an academic merit scholarship. Benson's
attorney is confident she will prevail in litigation against Columbia.
The case is being brought in Supreme
Court, New York County, and a judge will
be assigned to the case after November 15.
The suit is a special proceeding under Article 78 of the New YorkCivil Practice Law
and Rules, which provides that courts can
review arbitrary and capricious decisions of
schools and other administrative bodies.

Cooper lectures continue
By Erik Huneke
Ira Katznelson, in the words of political
science professor Carol Nackenoff, has had a
"major formative impact on a generation of
scholars of American politics." Mr.
Katznelson is the third speaker in the lecture
series entitled "The Politics of Possibility:
Forging Democracy in America." His lecture will be held on Thursday, November 11,
at 7:15 p.m. in the PAC cinema, will be
followed by a reception, and is sponsored by
the Cooper Foundation and the Department
ofPolitical Science.
According to Nackenoff, thepurpose of
the lecture series is to "bring [to campus]
prominent political and social scientists with
a strong interest in linking historically
grounded investigations with contemporary
issues," and that "all [speakers] are interested
in changing the debate about social policy in
the U.S." She hopes that this will "generate
some lively cross-departmental discussions
on this campus" about contemporary policy
issues and the need to foster democracy in the
Swarthmore tradition of "community involvement and activism."
In general, Katznelson has focused on
how politics of race and social class have
been patterned in the United States. In his
lecture, he will examine the factors in the
New Deal period which prevented the creation of a social democratic alliance in the
American political system.
Nackenoff states thathe "rejects the idea
that all roads in American history necessarily
lead to the post-war reassertion of American
exceptionalism—a kind of explanation for
why there is no socialism or social democracy in the United States" that is based on the
inevitable triumph of our "Lockean liberal
foundation." Katznelson discovered that
Southern Democrats supported the vast majority ofNew Deal programs, including progressive labor laws, but vetoed all laws pertaining to racial liberalism.
In the early 1940'5, however, the South
became burdened with the higher costs of
unionized labor that accompanied the industrialization required to support the war effort.

Many Southern white Democrats viewed the
establishment of trade unions as a means by
which a "rising black leadership" could challenge their authority.
According to political science professor Richard Valelly, Katznelson's thesis refutes V.O. Key's interpretation in the influential book Southern Politics, in which Key
asserted that Southerners were simply inclined to vote against racial liberalism. If
more of the work force had been unionized
and if unionization had been more of a national movement, it probably would have
developed a strong link to the civil rights
movement and thus allow both movements
to become more influentialforces in American society. In the 1942 and 1946 elections,
manynon-SouthernDemocrats lost their seats
in Congress, thus giving thosefrom the South
a much greater say in setting the legislative
agenda.
Katznelson has also studied the ways in
which people of African descent were first
incorporated into urban electoral politics in
the U.S. during the 1920's and in Great
Britain during the 1950'5. He found that in
this process "buffer institutions" provided
an outlet for blacks' desire for participation
and a way in which to use their energy that
was "harmless for the persistence of a system."
Aside from his scholarly work, he is an
"inspiring lecturer and a person with passion, intensity and moral commitment" who,
according to Valelly, feels just as comfortable working with democracy movements in
Eastern Europe as he does lecturing at
Tougaloo, one of the bestAfrican-American
colleges in the South.
WhileKatznelson will be the last speaker
of the series for this semester, three more
speakers are scheduled to give lectures next
semester. Next semester's speakers include
Michael Rogan, who will speak on relations
between African- Americans and Jewish
Americans during the early stages of the
American civil rights movement, and James
Morone, who will compare various aspects
of old and new forms of immigration.

"Complicated Flesh: New

Queer Film and Video" will be the

feature presentation in the PAC at
7p.m. on Tuesday, November 9.
This evening of film and video features internationally and locally
known gay and lesbianfilmmakers
and critics: Tom Kalin, Cheryl
Dunye, Brent Hill and AlisaLebow.
The presentationby these major artists willraise issues ofvital concern
to Swarthmore such as theintersections ofrace, desire, gender, sexual
orientationand identity politics.
The film and video event is an
opportunity forSwarthmore tomeet
a group of extremely talented artists. It will allow the college community to experience a new genre
having major impact on thefield of
video and filmmaking. It will also
serve as an important forumfor discussion or issues such as race, gender and sexuality which organizers
feel Swarthmorehas not adequately
explored.
"Complicated Flesh" will be
the first in what should become a
yearly videoand filmmaking event,
allowing McCabe to purchase the
works screened in order to form a
new collectionfor the video library.
The evening's format will consist
of 15 minutesofeachartist's recent
work, discussion between the artists concerning issues surrounding
New Queer Film and Video, and
ample time for dialogue between
the artists and those attending the
presentation.
Tom Kalin, writer, producer
and director, is perhaps the most
famous of the group. He is best
known for his independently produced feature length film Swoon,
which won the Cinematography
prize at the Sundance Film Festival.
Swoon is a retelling of theLeopold
and Loeb trials of the 1930'5, in
which two gay men were found
guilty ofmurder and jailed. Swoon
treats the same story as Alfred
Hitchcock's Rope. Kalin's short
works in film and video include
Puppets, Gesicht and News From

Home, which have been exhibited

internationally.
From 1987 to 1990 Kalin was
a producer at AIDSFTLMS, a nonprofit education company which
produces prevention educationvideos for communitiesofcolor. Heis
also a founding memberofthe AIDS
activist collective, Gran Fury.
Cheryl Duyne is a Philadelphia-based film, video and performance artist whose work explores
issues of race, sex and class in the
lives ofblack lesbians. Duyne utilizes documentary, fiction and
pseudo-documentary styles offilmmaking to achieve her own distinct
which
she
style,
calls
"Dunyementary." Her works, including She Don't Fade, are taught
in several courses at Swarthmore.
Dunye's video, The Potluck and
The Passion, was included in the
1993Biennial at the Whitney Museum of American Arts, and the
piece she will show on Tuesday
will be included in the 1993 Baltimore Lesbian and Gay Film and
Video Festival.
Dunye's work can be viewed
as a response to the gaymaledominated growth of independently produced feature length films known
as New Queer Cinema. She has
begun her first feature length film
entitled Watermelon Woman. The
film is a fake documentary about a
fake actress from the 1930'5. The
film grapples with issues of constructing a lesbian, black film history, and, in the process, creating a
lesbian black identity.
Brent Hill is a local Philadelphia artist whose first film,Victor,
has been screened in gay and lesbian film festivals across the country. The film, about a black gay
man in the military, recently aired
on the local PBS affiliate WHYY.
His latest work treats the subject of
disclosureof HIV status.
Alisa Lebow is an artist and
critic who writes on new lesbian
works. Hermostrecentarticle"New

in "Cineaste." She has done work
in video which deals mainly with

Student employees act to isolate Trent' and disinfect computers
By Andy Perrin
A new computer virus, nicknamed "Trent," was discovered almost simultaneously this week at
Swarthmore and the University of
Pennsylvania.
The virus, which renamed
Macintosh hard disks "Trent
Saburo" on Halloween, infected
numerous computers around campus, principally public-area
Macintoshes and those in students'
dormrooms.
Computer viruses are small
programs designed to attach themselves to existingprograms—often
infecting "system files," which are
required for all other programs to
run. Some viruses are designed to
wreak havoc on the information
stored in a computer, but Trent was
only intended to rename the hard
drive. The damage that did take
place was due to faulty programming.
When the virus was discovered
lateSunday and early Monday, computing center officials believed it
was written by a Swarthmore student as a Halloween prank, since it
hadnotbeenreported anywhere else.
It soon became clear, though, that

"Complicated Flesh" assembles four quality artists and addresses issues of race, desire, gender, sexual orientationand identity

of them together should generate
discussion.

Nationalist Party and the Nazi
Skinheads are planning to converge on New Hope, Pennsylvania (about 1 hour north of

Swarthmore) for "Gaybash '93,"

SC considers
Honors revamp
Possible changes include
decentralization, internal examiners
byErikHuneke
Last year the Council On Educational Policy concerned itself
with multiculturalism in the classroom; this year it is has concentrated on possible changes to the External Examination program
(EEP). The StudentCouncil held a meeting onThursday, November
4 to allow students to express opinions of the various proposals
suggested by the Council.
Certain departments are having trouble enticing students into
the program. It is felt that the existence of Course with Distinction
provides students with another way to graduate with honors and
dissuades them from pursuing the more in-depth work that characterizes the EEP program, commonly referred to as the Honors
program.
Among the aspects of the Honorsprogram that have come under
the Council's scrutiny are the fact that it represents a two-year
commitment whichprecludes students from having double majors,
studying abroad for a semester and doing an internship. Student
Council representative Asahi Pompey '94 believes that mis relative
lack of flexibility dissuadesstudents from considering"the program.
Thus, thereis a proposal to reduce therequired number of seminars
for an honors major from six to four.
Another issue has been the testing method. There is some
question as to whether the examiners should be chosen from the
college's faculty; currently they are selected from other universities
and brought to Swarthmore for a few days in the spring.
There has also been discussion over the advantages and disadvantages of having a panel of examiners rather than an individual
examiner. As a result of concerns expressed by students applying to
graduate school, the possibility of having grades on a semester or
yearly basis was put under consideration. These might take the form
of "shadow grades," which, according to Pompey, would not be
known to the student unless he/she requested them.
There is a general consensus that each department shouldhave
theright to define its Own specific standards for work in theHonors
program. Yet Pompey stresses that a "common thread**shouldexist
through all of the college departments. It could be that every
department "would require external exams, a thesis, or a student
presentation."
Although these are all speculations at this point and if implemented would not affect current students, they are expected to lead
to an ongoing discussion that will ultimately help the college to
better serve the needs of both its faculty and students.

The final verdict of the Reginald Denny beating case in Los Angeles was handed
down afew short weeks ago. Damian Williams, the principal assailant, was convicted
offelony mayhem on Denny, along with fourmisdemeanor assaults on other victims. His
co-defendant, Henry Watson, was found guilty on only one count offelonious assault.
Both, however, were found innocent of the most serious felony charges—attempted
murder carrying life sentences.
The savagery of the attack caught on videotape leaves many Americans with
understandablefrustration that thepunishment was not severe enough tofit the crime.
Similarly, mostpeople who saw the videotape offourLos Angeles police officers beating
Rodney King found it inconceivable that the officers couldbe acquittedby the original
jury. Both incidents were captured on video tape and all defendants were acquitted of
the most serious charges. In neither case was justice truly served.
The most troubling aspect ofthe second case was its symbolism in light ofthe first;
issues of racism, judicial fairness, and police brutality were unavoidable. This is
unfortunate, because it probably contributed to the almost tortured reasoning of the
prosecution, defense, and jury.
For example, for their own strategic purposes, neither the prosecution nor the
defense offered the jury an opportunity tofind one of the defendants guilty ofassault with
a deadly weapon (a brick). Why? Because conviction of that crime carries a lesser
penalty than simple mayhem, and would not add to his punishment.
Moreover, there has been endless speculation that the jury was excessively lenient
out ofeither sympathyfor the black defendants, orfearofsetting the sceneforyet another
riot. Los Angeles District Attorney Gil Garcetti commented, "The jury has returned a
verdict of peace, but not necessarily a verdict of justice." The most troublesome evidence
of the jury's leniency may have been its decision to reduce felony assault charges to
misdemeanors in the case ofattacks by Williams againstfour other victims.
Again, emotionally, thepunishments don'tseem severe enough. But, under thelaws
that applied in thisparticular case, the defense's claim was infallible, and the jury'sfinal
decisionfrustratingly logical. After all, how could a jury assume beyond a reasonable
doubt intent to kill based on a film? Given the nature ofthis case, the jury was not about
to infer anything beyond reasonable doubt.
In the end, the Rodney King and Reginald Denny incidents were reduced to jury
decisionsbased onfilmic and legal technicalities. What video cannot capture, however,
is thepain, grief, andfear these attacks have instilled inpeople both close and not so
close to the victims.
Thus far, very little good, if any, has come of the entire Rodney King incident.
Hopefully, we can transcend the bad taste these trials have left, and work towards
avoiding such cyclical racism, violence, and legal miscarriage in the future.

Today, the college is considering building a huge new building which will create a
wind-tunnel like alley between the new structure and the PAC while Old Tarble gathers

Yes, I know all the reasons why Old

what they told the people organizing the
Intercultural Center who wanted Old Tarble

the Old Club even had to change a concert's

of Public Safety and the Parkside Fire Company were allowed to hold an excellent Halloweenhauntedhouse in OldTarble last week
and all the big packages sent to the college at
the beginning of the semester were stored in

Intolerance harms all
To the Editor:
Walking around this campus,
there is quite a bit of discussion
about the talk by Phyllis Shlafly
which will, by the time thisis printed,
already haveoccurred. But her talk
is not what concerns me. Looking
around, I see numerous signs advertising her speech. Sadly, most of
them are torn in half, marked up, or
otherwise defaced. I think this activity epitomizes the insensitivity of
a few on this campus who wander
aimlessly serving their self-appointed role as thought-police.
Most students I know do not
deface signs. Most students I know
also disagree withMrs. Schlafly on
almost every issue. Most students
are, therefore, quite capable of disagreeing constructively with her,
without tearing down posters.
So which students are engaging in such an overt display of censorship? We can comfortably assume that conservative students are
not tearing down the signs, as they
brought her to campus. So is it
liberal students? No. Why? Because true liberals might disagree
with Mrs. Schlafly, but they understand that freedom of speech is important, that free exchange ofideas
is fundamental to education, that all
viewpoints must be heard. True
liberals accept varying view-points
and make a point ofhearing as many
voices as possible.
Therefore, the question still
remains, who is tearing down the
signs? The answer is one of the

uncomfortable and unfortunatefacts
of life at Swarthmore. A remarkably small percentage of this population is a quasi-liberal force which
gets its existence simply from opposing conservatives. These students are not actually liberal, but
they claim to be. Those whochoose
not to debate but rather to speak
with a pair of scissors represent a
purely destructive forcefor our community: they are not in any way
liberal.
Conservative or liberal, we all
have a vested interest in hearing
diverse viewpoints. Many disagree
with Mrs. Schlaflyfor her beliefs; I
am often inclined to agree with them.
But most of us behave constructively and allow opendebate. Those
who tear down signs disallow free
expression and are neither liberal
nor progressive: they are a minority
expressing a disturbing trend on
campus. Were they truly liberal
adults, they would not stand destructively behind their acts and
claim to be acting for the greater
good.

For what it is worth, Webster
defines liberal as "having viewy or
policies advocating individualfreedom of action and expression." To
theself-absorbed and insensitive few
who choose to act destructively, at
least have thecourage to call yourselves what you are: reactionary
censors. You give bothSwarthmore
and liberalism a bad name.

Labor policy and the myth of community
'...t0 comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable'
By Andy Perrin
So you think Swarthmore College is a
liberal community?
Do you still believe Swarthmore is a
place that welcomeseveryone, offering comfort, intellectual stimulation, and security to
everyone associated with the College?
I have a story that should shock you. It
shocks me still, and I've long since given up
on the possibility of Swarthmore carrying
through on the community values it claims.
It started a little over a year ago, when
some members of the dining services staff
asked me and some other supportive students
and faculty to publicize a problem they were
having. Management had required them to
purchase their own uniforms, which cost a
significant chunk of the money they earned.
Amid a barrage of claims that the workers'
discontent was unfounded and that we were
overreacting, the College quietly went ahead
and changed the policy, providing workers
with uniforms.
Through the course of that experience,
though, we found a deeper problem.
Swarthmore had no meaningful process by
which staff could bring grievances to management and expect to have them addressed.
Early in the second semester, a larger
group of students and faculty met with the
administrators responsible for organizing and
managing dining services and discussed the
issue. We offered to act as an intermediary for
workers' grievances, since we were convinced
that many went unheard by management.
We were assured thatthe College's grievance process was sound, and that workers felt
entirely comfortable using it. Furthermore,

we were told that the news of worker dissatisfaction was surprising, as the workers to
whom they had spoken were apparently
happy. Finally, we were told in no uncertain
terms that our involvement in the issue was
unwelcome.
In thefirst weeks of this semester, one of
the workers at Essie Mae's approached our
groupfor help in filing a complaint under this
process. He claimedhe hadbeen subjected to
harassment by a supervisor and had been
unfairly passed over for a promotion.
None of this mattered, though, because
he was summarily fired a few weeks later,
before he had a chance to file his complaint.
No negative performance reviews had been
filed on him for at least a year, and the
College has yet to provide him with the
grounds for his dismissal.
The worker is in the process of appealing the firing, which is why his name cannot
be used here. Regardless of the merits of the
case, though, it is clear that a fair and respectful process never entered therealm ofpossibility in this case.
I submit that the real measure of the
openness and justice of a community is the
way its most privileged members interact
with its least privileged. Swarthmore fails
that test miserably. The comfort of Swarthmore's students and faculty is based the
oppression ofits low-level staff, particularly
those in dining services and housekeeping.
This is not an issue that can be solved by
appreciating the workers more; it's not an
issue of attitude. It's a problem of institutional disrespect and blatant class and race
bias. The only solution is a radical restructuring ofSwarthmore's self-image and an insti-

tutional commitment to justice.
The people who work in dining services
and housekeeping deserve our respect, and
they deservebetter treatment. But even more
than that, they deserve a say over theirprofessional lives. They deserve an administration

that listens to their concerns, and they deserve
a representative organization with enough
power to guarantee that the administration
will listen. Without these changes,
Swarthmore's claims of community will ring
entirely hollow.

I remember thefirst sex education course
I ever had. It was in elementary school and
consisted mostly of discussions of anatomy.
The teacher was great: open to questions but
not prodding. She gave us the information
and told us how to get more, if we desired. It
was a good class, as far as it went. Through
the years it was followed up with other sex
education classes, none of which ever managed to do quite the same job. The flaw, I
believe, was in the goal of theseother classes:
the school attempted to become my confidant
instead of my tutor. The subsequent sex
education classes stopped telling me the possibleconsequences of given actions and started
trying to tell me how I should, in moral and yet
socially "cool" terms, act. There is a huge
difference between the two courses.
I know that some of education is learning
how to think, and hence what to think. What
I question is the right (and ability) of the
school to become deeply immersed in ethics,
which essentially what the new sex education
courses are doing. The courses have moved
from simply laying out the facts: If you do
X,Y, or Z you couldsuffer A, B, or C. Now
the class must address how we (as students,
children, adults, teachers, parents, society...)
feel about A, B, or C. Now the class must
discuss the infinite details and permutations
of X, Y, and Z. Now the classes must offer
guidance. The extreme example of this is the
offering of free condoms in school.
Now I have no quarrel with any private
institution which wishes to offer free gifts to
its subjects. Let them eat cake, for all I care.
What worries me is that public schools are
spending tax payers' money to buy and distribute free gifts. I do not think that the
majority of tax payers support the right of the
schools to do so. Further, these free gifts
come at a huge price: control.
Let the schools teach anatomy and reproduction. That is science. Let them teach it
exactly as they would calculus derivatives or
cell biology or Platonic ethics. That is their
job. Their responsibility, however, stops there.
They cannot tell my children to have sex, or
even not to have it. That is morality and the
teaching of morality is my job as a parent.

The teacher can describefetal development or
egg fertilization. That is part of the miracle of
life which is described in the discussions of
DNA and cell biology that form the cornerstone ofmany biology courses. The nurse can
offer information of various methods of birth
control. That is part of her job in describing
any medical methods.
But do not preach to my children). And,
just as you would not offer them robes and
nooses when discussing the history of the
KKK, do not offer them the trappings of sex.
And by that lousy reference, I specifically
mean do not give them birth control. The job
of the school is to introduce the child to
learning, not offer them morality plays in the
false name of necessity.
By offering condoms to students the
school is abrogating the rights and responsibilities of both parent and student. I will
discuss with my child the morality of sex, just
as I would the morality of lynch mobs or the
ten commandments. And that might mean
that I donot want my child to have sex until he
is married or it might mean that I will condone
any sexual proclivity that he may or may not
express. In either case, so long as lam not
breaking any laws, that is a dialogue to be
experienced in the private sphere: my home.
Personally I think that if my child is not adult
enough to walkinto a drug store and purchase
a box of condoms without worrying if the
mean old druggist will frown, then he is also
not adult enough to engage in sex. Sex, like
any other part of life, is both a blessing and a
responsibility. An adultmust take theresponsibility at the same time as the right. That is
what I will teach my child.
The school, however, has no right, even with
the best of intentions, to interfere, justas I have no
right to go into my neighbor's house to force his
children to convert to Quakerism. Morality,
within the limitsof the law, which offers quite a bit
of breadth, is a personal, private transaction. The
government cannot legislate it The school, as a
function of the government, cannot teach it. And
that, to me, means that it also cannot confute my
teachings. The distribution, by public schools, of
condoms in particular and sexual morality in
general, is just that an unwanted and deleterious
interference withmy right as a parent to guide my
children in their moral lives.

Duct tape is the alpha and the omega
Without this "universal elixir vitae," the world as we know it would fall apart

Berkeley Breathed

The perfect
Formal date
By Adam Blakeley
Hello again, and welcome to my favorite
time ofyear. It happens oncea semester, when
everyone on campus is encouraged to feel
socially inept and desperate to find someone he
or she can toleratefor a couple ofhours. Yes,
of course, I'm speaking of the Formal.
Your average formal-goers fall into three
categories. The first is all thosewho are already
seeing someone. Everyone hates these people.
They don'thave to bother withthe anxieties of
asking someone; they don't really have to
worry about scaring their dates off by their
attire; they don't even have to stay at the
dance.They make an appearance, dance a bit,
realize they'd rather be watching Saturday
Night Live starring Joan Rivers with musical
guest Four Non Musicians, and sneak off. Such
forms ofescape areperfectly acceptable for the
established couple.
Then there is formal-goer number two.
This poor shlep has made the decision to go
ahead and ask a "friend" to the formal. Whether
or not any romantic schemes are afoot, these
two are in for quite a ride. After the obligatory
pictures (Accept it—you will smile like an
idiot) comes the Senior Class "Let's Serve
Andre at$6 a Pop and Pretend it's Classy" Preformal. By established tradition, one person in
every #2 couple must get blitzed. This rule is
primarily to provide entertainment for couple
#1 before they leave the formal. It also serves
as an excuse for the inane attempt at a hook-up
while slow-dancing later in the evening. (As
in, kiss, slap, "Oh I'm sorry, I thoughtyou were
someone else.")
If they're really lucky, both members of
couple #2 will get bombed, hook up, start
seeing each other, and makeeach other miserablefor years to come. This is how we get the
Quaker Matchbox.
Then we have couple #3. Or rather the
lack thereof. This is comprised of all thosewho
decide to screw the conventions of the dating
scene and go without a date. Usually, this
occurs in packs, as three or more Swatties
collectively say 'To HellWith It." This is now
being actively encouraged by the gurus who
run title damn thing. I saw a sign the other day
which read: "We, the Gurus who Run This
Damn Thing, Cordially Invite You to the Formal. We Realize That Most of You Have No
Desire To Actually Go With Anyone at this
School But We Blew Quite a Wad on this
Thing, and the SeniorClass Needs YourMoney,
so Please Come Anyway."
The problem with going alone is that if
your friends have dates, you're pretty much
screwed. There'salso no one obligated to take
care ofyou if youfind yourself overlypartial to
the Pre-formal sparkling wine.
Thus, there is a fundamental problem to
most Formals. They're hard to avoid outright,
but they're also difficult to enjoy, no matter
what your status as far as a date. Of course, I
have theperfect solution to this dilemma. Bring
your sister.
Now, before you scoff, consider the advantages:

1.) She normally won't refuse. Unless
you're a jerk.
2.) You can explain it easily to prying
friends: "It was the only weekend she could
come," or something like that. Note that you
often cannot explain awayreal dates so easily.
3.) Her gettingtipsy atthePre-formal is an
excellent excuse to leave early.
4.) You won't have to worry about when
to makeyour move. (Note: this may not apply
to residents of Alabama.)
A word of caution, particularly, though
not necessarily, to women don't bring your
brother. Brothers tend to view visiting college
as full permission to let theirhormones have a

the Eagles released QB Ken

hope that doesn't mean that former
Seminole Casey Weldon gets the
nod The Cardinals have been relatively successful at shedding their
"perenial pushover" status this season. Among their victories is included a two-game sweep against
the Redskins. Although Philadelphia has a more talented defense,
offense scores points and that is
what the Eagles are sadly lacking.
In an upset, I'm going with theCardinals in Tempe. Winner: CARDINALS.
Jets vs. Dolphins: In thiscritical AFC East match-up, you have a
New York team which has stayed
healthy and has become one of the
AFC's best teams and a Miami team
which has lost its star QB Dan
Marino yet still has found ways to
win. Coming off a huge emotional

Dolphins are most likely breathing

a sigh of relief. The Chiefs are a
tough team, though an inconsistent
one. In the Jets, the Dolphins find a
high-scoring offense and stingy defense with quality veteran players at
all the key positions. In what could
prove to be a tight division race, the
Jets edge the Dolphins in theMeadowlands. Winner: JETS.
Browns vs. Broncos: This
matchup brings to mind those classic playoff games between these
same two teams some five or six
years ago. In two consecutive seasons, Cleveland and Denver met in
theAFC Championship Game, with
Denver winning by virtue of an

Byner's a Redskin. Former Broncos coach Dan Reeves is now with
the Giants. Former Browns coach
Marty Schottenheimer is now with
Kansas City. But in 1993,both teams
are contenders for the playoffs.
Cleveland is still embroiled in a bit
of a QB controversy which has left
the offense in an unsettled state.

Swat volleyball concludes strongly
Team defeats Albright in five sets to give seniors fond farewell
By David Lischer
Swarthmore's women's volleyball team played theirhearts out
in their final game of the season, a
thrilling five-game match, beating
Albright (15-3, 7-15, 15-6, 14-16,
16-14). The victory gave Swat a
15-14 record for the season and
allowed the team to avoid a sub.soo finish.

Wendy Williams '97 explained that records aren't as important as they are made out to be:
"The team is such good friends off
the court, that even if we had a
losing season, it would have been
worth it."
For Swat's five departing seniors, co-captains Way-Ting Chen
and Katie Westin, Jenny Willis,
Christina Richards and Vilma

Peter Yoho

the women's basketball team shoots lay-ups as they prepare

forthe upcoming season. Watch for a preview in The Phoenix.

Huertas, the match was one they
will always remember. After Swat
cruised through the first game of
the match, winning easily 15-3,
they jokingly suggested that they
make the match a five-setter so
they could depart with a bang. Little
did they realize that this would be
the outcome.
Bad judgment cost Swarthmore several crucial points in game
two and allowed Albright to seize
the momentum. Serves faltered on
both
sides
and
despite
Swarthmore's determined play,

Albright prevailed 15-7.
Swarthmore leapt to an early
4-1 lead in game three, which soon
disintegrated into a 4-4 tie. However, in the middle of this crucial
comeback, Albright's tallest player
injured her ankle and play had to be
stopped. Capitalizing on this timeout, Swat returned to the court refreshed and dominated the rest of
the gamewith its hitting to win 156.
It appeared that Swat had
the match all wrapped up in game
four as it took leads of 5-0 and 94. Albright lost all composure,
and their coach received a yellow cardfor continually badgering the referee about calls. Yet
somehow Albright fought back
to tie the game at 10-10 and
eventually won 16-14. The dramatic game five was a near-replay of game four, except that
Swat won thegame, and thus the
match. "It was the best way to
end the season for our seniors,"
said Williams.
The most important part of
Swat's last match was the attitude the team tookintothe game.
Everyone on the court was having fun, and everyone on the
bench put their hearts into supporting them. This positive attitude has been with the team all
season. "It was fabulous, we
had a great time," said Westin.
Inreminiscing over her four
years ofSwat volleyball, Westin
said, "It [women's volleyball]
was the best introduction I ever
could have had at Swarthmore
from preseason to the regular
season in terms of meeting
people... I couldn't be more
thankful."
