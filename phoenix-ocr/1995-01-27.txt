SWARTHMORE, PENNSYLVANIA

Vigil Honors Slain
Clinic Workers
By Fred Bush
For about forty Swarthmore students, a trip to Philly last Sunday did
not mean South Street or shopping.
The Swatties joined a crowd of more
than 1,600 and together honored the
workers and doctors killed in the recent attacks on women's health clinics. The marchers left three separate
Philadelphia clinics at 5:45 and
walked, carrying candles and signs
such as "Pennsylvania for Choice,"
said Herrin Hopper '9B, co-leader of
Swarthmore's Pro-Choice Task
Force. After reaching the First Unitarian Universalist Church the group
listened to speeches on the hazards
and struggles involved in working at
a women's health clinic.
Clergy representing four different
religions spoke about death as a form
of justice. Choi Sam, a Unitarian
minister. Rabbi Alan Fuchs of Congregation Rodeth Shalom, Father
Paul Washington, an Episcopalian
priest, and Baptist Rev. Benjamin
Maucere all. A few of them argued
that the killers of these clinic workers
should not be themselves put to death,
a view with which some of the audience disagreed. However, the diversity of the speakers lent strength to
the program, said Matt Van Itallie
'9B, who participated in the vigil along
with many otherCivilLiberties Society members.
After the clergy spoke, representatives from the three Philadelphia clinics, the Escort Coordinator for
Planned Parenthood of Southeast
Pennsylvania and the director of
NARRAL (National Abortion/ Reproductive Rights Action League)
addressed the gathering.

The most moving of the speeches,
Hopper said, came when two of the
clinic directors read aloud letters of
solidarity from doctors. Trish
Sneddon, director of the Philadelphia Women's Center, read one from
an OB -GYN doctor who spoke of the
insane amounts of fear and hatred
and threats and stalking a clinic doctor must endure.
Barbara Weber of the Elizabeth
Rockwell Women's Center provided
a more personal and poignant moment. She read a letter she had written to her 8-year-old son in case she
died on the job. She feared for her life
but continued her work. She spoke of
fighting for ideals no matter what the
cost, of standing firm whatever the
danger, of being called a murdererby
many and facing therisk of murder.
In some way, she said, all theworkers
at clinics throughout America were
dealing with these problems.
Many saw the vigil as a moral
builder for both the clinic workers
and people who participated in it.
"The sense of solidarity and communion with one another would help
allay the fears of further danger, of
further murders," said Van Itallie.
Hopper saidthat the threats of violence have affected the 10 to 15 ProChoice Task Force members who
serve as escorts at the Philly clinics,
but in a positive way. More people
are volunteering to serve as escorts.
"It's almost as if the sense of dangerhas increased their resolve," said
Hopper. Herself anescort, whenasked
whether she thought it was dangerous, replied "I am not scared because
it has to be done and I completely
believe in it. I am not intimidated by
thepeople who are trying to stop us."

Clinansmith Amends Lawsuit
By Sam Schulhofer-Wohl

Alexis Clinansmith '97 has
amended the lawsuit she filed last
year over the College's handling of
her sexual harassment complaint
against fellow student Ewart
Yearwood, who has since transferred
to Boston University.
Clinansmith's lawyer now contends that her case was not unique,
but rather formed part of "a pattern
and practice" of discrimination
against women who were victims of
sexual misconduct. The complaint
demands, in addition to monetary

damages, a court order declaring that
the College violates federal anti-discrimination laws.
"In my mind, her allegations are
demonstrably false," President Al
Bloom said yesterday.
In a statement issued December
22, Harry Gotwals, Vice-President
for Alumni, Development, and Public Relations, called Clinansmith's
suit "totally unjustified."
"The College has responded vigorously to each of the allegations in
Federal Court," he said.
The lawsuit contends, among other

things, that the College shut down

Drawing upon their own experiences as student activists, PaulBooth
'64 and Dr. Robert Ross gave a lecture entitled, "Agents or Victims:
Students and Social Change" on
Monday evening in Kirby Lecture
Hall. The talk was one of a series of
events scheduled this week as part of
the Swarthmore Civil Liberty
Society's Students' Rights Week. As
Mohan Ambikaipaker '95 noted it
was one of many opportunities this
week for students to "develop consciousness and support systems."

he feels today given the present hostility towards government involvement in social problems."Mr. Booth
emphasized that "our... leverage [for
social change] is based on exercising
the strength of majorities."Mr. Booth
also gave examples from his past of
effective student organization, for
example the protests against Apartheid which led to divestiture.
For half an hour following thelecture students engaged in dialogue
with the speakers over various questions. Mr. Booth said
that if he was a stuhe

be "frightened about

When asked what issue
would be concentrating on if
he were in college today, Mr
Booth said that he would be
"frightened about what happened on November Bth"
Dr. Ross, a social policy analyst
and chair of the Sociology Department at Clark University, outlined
what he felt to be the key issues of
social change which involve students,
notably the need to make higher education universally available and to
reduce higher education's cost tostudents.Mr. Booth, Labor Union Organizer for The American Federation

November Bth" and
would focus on students' reactions to
that issue. He also
saidthathe wouldbe
"trying to organize
around the issue of
higher education and
its availability" and, finally, the need
for social change in communities
nearby Swarthmore.
Students were especially interested
inhearing about the studentactivism
of the 1960's and the ways in which
the 1968 student movement in Paris
changed the vision of the student as
an agent of radical political change.
Both speakers responded that in cer-

tain cases it gave students "a heady
sense ofrevolutionism" and led them
"too far" but that a strong sense of
student solidarity resulted as well.
Discussion was given to the question of all levels of education. When
asked about the public school system, Mr. Ross remarked that there is
a need for increased resources and
administration, but he cautioned
against buying into an ideology that
justifiesdisinvesting in public education. He added that he believes there
is a movement in America today
against public education which the
facts about the system do not merit.
The discussion ended with a question raised by Ambikaipaker, a member of Swarthmore's Coalition
Against Xenophobia, who asked
about ways for students to communicate with thepeople for whoserights
they fight, in order to help thosewhose
rights are impunged to become voices
of their own empowerment. He also
asked how the "paternalistic" position of many student movements
might be avoided. Neither speaker
could offer an immediate solution,
butboth agreed to the importance of
the involvement not only of students'
voices, but also of the voices whom
students try to represent, in the

struggle for social change.

Matt Van Itallie '9B, Secretary
Generalof the S warthmore CivilLiberties Union, remarked that he was
pleased with the number of students
who attended the lecture. He said that

to him, "activism

is one of the best
things about Swarthmore." He felt
the lecture was important because it
raised Swarthmore students' awareness about the history of students'
rights and activism. Furthermore, it
heightened attention to the changes
student activism has undergone since
its 1960's inception.
One student remarked that she
found the talk "highly inspirational"
and another emphasized the importance of talks such as this one which
explore the "pragmatic aspect of organizing and social action." Maria
Barker '96 noted, "I find it hard to
get excited about political actionbut
this helps. I am especially interested
in what they were saying about financing higher education." This is
an issue she can see students getting
involved in because "it's our lives."
For many, the talk seemed to function as encouragement and as an
impetus to social change.

Psychological Services during part of

Spring semester last year. College
officials denied the charge.
Survivors of sexual assault and
harassment occasionally complain
that the administration responds inappropriately to their concerns, said

Colleen Bartley '96, a leader of
Friends of Survivors. But she added
that, on the whole, she thinks the
College tries hard to assist victims of
sexual misconduct.
"I think there's a desire to support,
and I think ideally they really, really
want to, but I question the way that
they currently do it," Bartley said. "I
don'tknow how well it's handled for
the victim and the accused. I'm glad
they encourage counseling for the
perpetrator, as well, and don't just
write people off. The only way to
prevent future incidents is through
education."
Over the past two years, the College has made substantial changes in
the way it responds to students who
say they have been harassed or assaulted, according to Dean Ngina
Lythcott.
"We've worked hard to make the
code of conduct more responsive to
the needs of students," she explained.
"More important was the hiring of the
gender education advisor, Karen
Henry, who has been working with
student groups on ways they can educate theirpeers to prevent sexual misconduct."
In addition to working with organizations including Friends of Survivors and ASAP, Henry, who was hired
in November 1993, counsels victims
on their options for responding to
sexual harassment and assault. She is

also organizing a "response team" of
faculty and staff members who will
be trained to advise victims of sexual
misconduct.

The Tri-College Coalition Against Xenophobia (CAX) started to re-group at a meeting

American Debaters

on Monday after successfully organizing rallies against California's Proposition 187 in
Philadelphia and across the country last year.
Three days after a regional coalition of similar movements met to set a suggested overall
agenda for its member groups, over fifty TriCollege students gathered to debatethe various
resolutions.The East Coast Student Coordination Meeting's resolutions include declarations
of the movement's fundamental belief: "We
stand united against California's Proposition
187 and similar measures." They go on to
describe the movement's intention to "work to
involve as many students, professors, and fac-

The resolutions call for cities to become
"official safe havens," and members to lobby
the U.S. Congress on behalf of illegal immigrants. The document concludes with a vigorous cry for the education of "ourselves, our
communities, our nation" about the issues and
implications raised by Prop. 187 and the like."
The group also discussed activities being
planned on a national level for February. The
group has scheduled a National Campus Day
of Action and Education for February 7 and a
day of community oriented activity on the 18th.
The campus-oriented day will bring teachins designed to boost campus awareness of
current developments inregards to the proposition, as well as the "broader trend of xenophobia" that it represents. The community outreach day was scheduled to coincide with the

Alvera Street Hunger Strike, a high school and

college student-leadevent in Los Angeles which
is part of the area's Four Winds Student Move-

ment.

Mohan Ambikaipaker '95proposed thatCAX
work to create a pledge that would be taken by
graduating seniors in opposition to Proposition
187. The pledge would apply most directly to
future health care workers, teachers, and social
workers, people who would most likely be
confronted by the application of Proposition
187. The pledge would act as a call to noncompliance.

While members of the group expressed enthusiasm over this idea, there was debate over
whether it is the place of CAX to encourage
civil disobedience.Similar debate was sparked
in response to a call within the list of resolutions for a: "stand in solidarity with those who
engage in nonviolent civil disobedience against

Chang-Muy To Join
Provost's Office in July
By Sam Schulhofer-Wohl

Jack-of-AU-Trades Fernando Chang-Muy,
who holds three different jobs at the College,
will leave his half-time post as Coordinatorof
Student Activities to take a new position, also
half-time, as an assistant to Provost Jennie
Keith. The job change takes effect July 1.
"I'm human. I only have so many hours and
so many hands," Chang-Muy explained when
asked why he chose to leave the StudentActivities job. "I feel that I have left behind a sturdy
infrastructure [to help student organizations]."
As Student Activities Coordinator, ChangMuy advised the Tarble Social Directors, who
lead the Social Affairs Committee, and the

student managers of Paces. He also served as
liaison between the Dean's office and Student
Council, and was responsible for the College's
annual Guide to Student Life.
Chang-Muy will retain his other two jobs,
Assistant Dean and Director of the Intercultural Center, and Equal Opportunity Officer.
"He's done a lot of wonderful things," said
Ngina Lythcott, Dean of the College. "I'm
thrilled that he's continuing as Assistant Dean
and Director of the IC."

Lythcott has asked Student Council to name
two students to a search committee to select a
new activities coordinator. Applications are
due at 4 p.m. today in the envelope on the
Student Council bulletin board.

The Committee again deliberated in order
to identify appropriate sanctions and decided
as follows:

In keeping with the recommendations of
thefaculty as found in the Student Handbook,
page 21, the student was given a notational
suspension for spring semester, 1995; in addition* the Committee recommended to the
professor that the student fail the course.
The Committee would like to remind students that academic dishonesty is a very serious matter. When a student is not sure about
this policy's implications for a particular class
assignment, it is the student's responsibility
id ask the professor.

other American teams didnot perform particularly well, leading to questions about potential
bias against American parliamentary debating
style.
Mallory said that he and Potischman "remained undefeated the longest through the nine
preliminary rounds." According to Joe Khan
'97, they were the first Swarthmore team "to
break intoWorlds out-rounds since 1987."Outrounds are a secondary series of debates between preliminary and final competition.
Mallory added that only two American teams
made it further this year, and both consisted of
graduate students.
Some of the camaraderie among teams from
different countries seemed to crumble during
the event. This was most evident in discussion
conducted
on-line
in
newsgroup
swat.list.debate, in which competitors from
various schools have expressed a wide variety
of opinions as to why, as Mallory put it, the
"APDA did not fare as well as most people
would have wished this year."
Mallory believes multiple factors contributed to this outcome. The first was the fact that
while many foreign teams consisted of older,
more experienced graduate students, the APDA
"openly discourages non-undergrads from debating." Secondly, the world championship is
usually conducted in the British debating style,
which"differs significantly from the American
style." Although most judges and even foreign
teams were encouraged in workshops at the
event to adapt their criteria to the American
style, many of the judges—the majority of
whom were not American—remained unfamiliar with the American technique.
Although a final decision has been postponed until next year, a rule which will make all
teams conform to the British style is likely to
pass. Only the American and Canadian teams
oppose this initiative.

The discrepancy in debating style was complicated by apparent bias against American
debaters, who are stereotyped, Mallory said, as

"anal-retentive policy analysts."
Subsequent discussion among American
participants has been characterized by what
Mallory calls "the 'we suck' factor." Mallory
disputes the claim that the quality of the debaters in the APDA has declined, although he
admits that teams have become smaller and the

average age of participants lower. When seasoned debaters find themselves in senior positions, they see "a horde of younger, less-experienced debaters" and tend not to realize that
the members of this group are likely to become
experienced debaters themselves. Mallory believes that "as these frosh age and gain experience, the circuit will improve."
Two other Swarthmore teams, consisting of
Sarah Cebik '95 and Chuck Stevens '97, and
Khan and David Lewis '97, also attended the
event, where they competed against 242 teams
from around the world. Aaron Feuer '94 also
participated as a representative of a yeshiva in
Israel.
Swarthmore debaters were also active in the
adoption of a new constitution for the American Parliamentary Debate Association (APDA),

of which Swarthmore is a founding member.
Mallory also participated in the WorldUniversities Debating Council (WUDC), which he
said serves as "the governing organization for
debate across the globe."
The rewards of the event extended beyond
the mere comparison of per formance in competition. According to Cebik, it was not only a
"chance to make contact with people all over
the world" but also an opportunity to "get to
hear an amazing array of perspectives on all
kinds of issues." She enjoyed the congenial
atmosphere generated by a "debate society
[which] is supportive of all its members, whether
they do amazingly well or not."M allory agreed,
saying that "Amos J. Peaslee [the Swarthmore
debate

society] proved itself to be

A Day in the Life

Note to Newt: Spare the Arts
The January 8 issue ofThe New YorkTimes reported Representative John A. Boehner, a Republican from Ohio,
as articulating the view of the new Republican House, that "it is not within the scope of Washington, not within
the scope of the Federal Government, to be involved in funding arts activities around America."
The recent House proposal to reduce or eliminate funding for programs like the National Endowment for the
Arts and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting illustrates our government's disregard for artistic excellence.
The CPB and NEA are able to maintain standards that would not survive in a free-market context.
Congress claims that privatization liberates the arts and media from constraints imposed by the government on
its grants. It also argues that in a free-market system the popular will prevail, that the people should choose for
themselves, and that if the work of these artists and broadcasters is of value to the country, support will come from
the private sector.
Such is the way of a capitalist nation. But this is taking it too far.
Let us consider the state of privately funded media and arts. The fact that extreme violence and gratuitous sex
have become commonplace in movies and on television hardly requires substantiation. As an example, though,
there were two consecutive incidents in October of 1993 in which children were killed while immitating what they
had seen on TV or in movies—one from the football movie 'The Program," the other from the popular show
"Beavis and Butthead." Is there a way to escape the immorality portrayed in the media and art of the private sector?
Yes, there is.To do so, itis necessary to maintain an area in whichthe experts of the field, rather than the consuming
public, determine the product. The only way to maintain excellence is to provide funding of selected broadcasting
and arts that is independent of public opinion. The only institution with that kind of power is government. Congress
must continue to support the CPB and NEA.
While federal funding does constrain artists and broadcasters in some ways, it serves the essential role of
sheltering them from apublic that demands vulgarity in entertainment. It is the responsability ofAmerica's leaders
to protect the quality and integrity of these fields.

Turning a Deaf Ear to Students

common sense. In addition, has the

was discussed at a Student Council

setup, SAC funding was increased to
improve the social life for students,
and the installation of telephones and
the campus network has been noted
and appreciated.
But what about countless other issues? Here are four concerns which I
have heard discussed over the last
four years which I have never heard
answered:

1) The need for a winter reading
week. In the spring there is a reading
week, ostensibly since Honors students will utilize the additional time
to study for exams. What about the
winter when everyone else is studying? Education at Swarthmore has
been likened to trying to take a drink
of water from a fire-hose. Since the

meeting last

semester, but
seems to have changed.

it took to make a place accessible,
Swarthmore would be at the top of

follow. Also, when the weather makes
the going rough, security will drive
any mobility-impaired guesi or resident everywhere he or she needs to
go on campus. Furthermore, Registrar Jane Mullins will relocate a class
if a student is unable to make it to the
room.

With that said, I think it is fair to
say that, although far from perfect,
Swarthmore is headed in the right

direction.
So, it's the end of the week and
(with any luck) you won't be seeing
me in a wheelchair for quite some

Winter Break at Bon Jovi's Record Label
By Dan Sachar

Sick of bands coming to Swat with names
never heard of? Feel left out because
you're not familiar with the band "The
Depressed Weirdos From Hell" who are playing
at the Olde Club Friday night? Well, I too felt a
need for a break from this Indie Rock enclave
otherwise known as Swarthmore College.
Luckily I found the perfect cure to such an ailment: work at Bon Jovi's record label! So I spent
my winter break interning at the head offices of
Mercury Records, a branch of Polygram Record
Distribution, in New York City.
This experience dispelled many myths about
the music world. Myth #1: CDs are worth something. That's right, naive music purchaser, save
those duckets for something worth the dinero—
CDs are not valuable items considering the way
the people in this office were tossing them
around like paper. "Hey Dan, do you like James?
Yeah? Here, have a few CDs of theirs." And you
just paid $l4 for their latest album! I say no to
this conspiracy to drain wallets! In reality, we

you've

should be getting a CD with every meal at
Tarble (that is, only if you don't get cream
cheese with your bagel; if you do, you have to
put the CD back).
Myth #2: Major labels only pick bands who
are going to be successful and stay away from
audacious, risk-taking bands with true integrity.
I have one word for you: Cinderella. No, not the
band who sang "Cherry Pie" (that was Warrant),
but you're not far off. You might have thought
such nightmares were simply results of the
Reagan administration, but no, Mercury Records
has brought back the "80s by sponsoring a new
album and tour by Cinderella, the long-haired
rockers who keep the Vavoom! hair-spray company in business. Not a wise business move, but
when artistry is at stake, why compromise?
Enough about the music industry. Why focus
on such substantive issues when what you really
want to read about is my personal experiences?
Well, my first couple weeks at Mercury
involved a lot of faxing, filing, xeroxing, and

distributing. Basically, typical intern work. But,
this experience was made pretty interesting by

the other people in the office, all of whom were
pretty cool and with whom I had some interesting talks about music. The real interesting stuff
came in my final week of work, when I was
given the assignment of doing promomotional
work on the tour of a new Mercury band called

Downset.
To get an idea of what kind of a band I was
promoting, take Rage Against the Machine,
make them even heavier and even angrier. I
mean, Downset is angry. Their cover features a
man blindfolded by the American flag with a
gun pointing towards his head. Ouch. OK, so I
can work with this, I thought. I called the promoters for various shows and offered them promotional material.
This was basically straightforward stuff, but
there were a few interesting moments talking to
the promoters: 1) "You know this is going to be
a great show. It's so great that the kids get to
experience such terrific stuff like this. It's great
for thekids!" Keep in mind that this man is talking about a band with lyrics such as, "ANGER!
THE L.A.P.D. KILLED MY Fs#%@
DADDY!!!" Great for the kids. What ever happened to Raffi? 2) "Look, I'll be honest with
you. I don't like Mercury. I don't like Downset.
They sold out, signed to a major label, and that's

the kiss of death. I don't like the whole situation
and I'm not happy about this show. Besides that,
what promotional materials can you offer me?"
And finally, my personal favorite, my call to a
California promoter, 3) "I'm sorry, he's not in
today, his house is flooded and he is trying to
keep it from falling off the hill." Whoa.
Basically, what's the point of all this? The
point is this: the music industry is a varied and
complex place. It's not all simple as Indie
good and Major bad, which is sometimes the
impression painted by the Swattie rock scene.
There are a lot of good people with integrity
working at a major label such as Mercury. There
is also a lot of good music coming out of major
labels. There is, granted, also a lot of bad music

with soldiers at doorsteps. Several studies
have been conducted comparing the number
of gun-related incidents in the U.S. with the
number of gun-related incidents in China,
where guns are not allowed. These studies
showed conclusive evidence that people were
less likely to be injured by a gun when a gun
was not around.
Still, many believe that these studies were
biased, and that an equalcomparison could not
be made between the two countries, since guns
were legal in one country but not the other. To
prove their point, they conducted studies of
their own comparing the U.S. with the U.S.
They found no statistically significant difference in gun-related incidents between this
country and itself.
Proponents of gun control argue that the
Constitution is as outdated as things which are
very outdated, such as hula-hoops. Opponents
of gun control disagree, arguing that hulahoops are still in style. Proponents of gun control then reply that they knew that the opponents

would disagree: that's why they're

called opponents.

But childish bantering is not the answer.
Gun control is a serious problem which
requires a serious discussion written by somebody else. Until that day, we will have to face
that fact that some people seem to want gun
control, while others don't.

however, were faced with another close one.
The men won, looking better than they have

standout swims were fromMarkFriedberg '9B.
He blew the competition out of the water in the

The women were never certain of their victory, but with solid swims, and an error on the
part of the opposing coach, they won convincingly. In a dramatic medley relay finish, Kim

After Vacation Garnet Sets Sights on Division Lead
by David Lischer
Having endured a three-week interruption for the holidays, the men's
basketball team is fighting to recover
the emotional fervor of the first third
of its season. Before break, the Garnet had scored impressive victories
over Dickinson and Haverford to go
to 2-1 in the Centennial Conference.
Last week, after defeating
Gettysburg 74-59 the Garnet fell to
undefeatedFranklin and Marshall 7962. Forward Kirk Daulerio '95 led all
scorers with 23 points while forward
Chad Tarr '95 played solid off-the-

bench with 12 points.
Against Gettysburg center Sam
Voolich '96 (17 pts., 14 rebounds)
and guard Colin Convey '97 (17 pts.,
five assists) had stellarperformances
as the Garnet capitalized on their
rebounding advantage (52-27) and
excellent free throw shooting (2736). Neither Voolich (10-10) nor
Convey (6-6) missed from the line.
Currently resting in second place
in their division, the Garnet (3-2, 79) have a chance to seize first place if
they beat Ursinus last night and defeat current division leader Washington (Md.) on Saturday. Every re-

maining game is crucial because only
the two teams with the best conference records from each divisionmake
the playoffs and therein, have a shot
at a national tournament berth.
However, the Garnet started slow
after the holidays against two strong
opponents, Yale and Lebanon Valley, the defending Division 111 champion. After crushing Delaware Valley 72-47 on the strength of its starting forwards Daulerio (19 points)
and Ben Schall '97 (12 pts.), the
Garnet succumbed to a balanced
Lebanon Valley attack.
Lebanon Valley held the Garnet to
a miserable 23% field goal percentage in the firsthalf and led at halftime

continue the strong play they had
shown against Moravian. Yale capitalized on 24 Garnet turnovers and a
12 rebound margin to win 91-46.
Daulerio contributed 17 points in
the losing effort. In a highly controversial loss to Philadelphia Pharmacy in which both sides received

technical fouls and a ridiculous 53

personal fouls were called, four Garnet players scored in double figures.
Daulerio and Voolich each scored 17
points, and forward Chad Tarr sunk
five ofhis seven shots for 13points. In
the backcourt, Rodner scored 11points
and had three assists and three steals.

40-24. But in the second half the
Garnet matched them almost point
per point and managed a much more

respectable 44% from thefield. Again
Daulerio and Schall led the Garnet
with 18 and 14 points respectively.
The Garnet shook off their shooting woes against Moravian two days
later and set a season high team field
goal percentage of 50%. Cushioned
by a 15 point lead at halftime, the
Garnet cruised to a 72-58 victory.
Daulerio contributed 17 points and
snatched 13 boards. Guards Convey
and Craig Rodner '96 dished out 14
assists to the hot Garnet shooters. In
addition to his eight assists Convey
connected on seven of ten shots for
16 points. Voolich made a solid contribution in his first start of the season
with 10points and five boards.
Hitting outside shots is essential to
the Garnet's success. In running their
"inside-out" offense, they look to
create open shots for their guards and
forwards by setting a lot of screens.
The question was whether there
would be adequate shooters to fill
these roles this season. Daulerio's

Men's Basketball Practices Hard for Upcoming conference battles

Chargers to Pull Upset and Beat Spread
by Neal Potischman and Nathan Hegedus
As Super Bowl fever sweeps across
the heartland, America braces for the
titanic clashbetween the NFC Cham-

pion San Francisco Forty-Niners
(49ers) and the AFC Champion San

Diego Chargers. In this West Coast
duel between the powerful defense
of the Chargers and the high octane
offense of the 49ers, Super Bowl
XXIX promises to be closely watched
in Las Vegas (if nowhere else).
The betting line shows the 49ers as
twenty point favorites over the Chargers, the largest spread ever in Super
Bowl history. Many sports fans saw
last weekend's NFC Championship
match-up between the defending Super Bowl ChampionDallas Cowboys
and the revamped 49ers as the battle
between the two best teams in football; little is expected of the Charg-

ers.
Added to the underwhelming
Charger roster the fact that the NFC
representative to the Super Bowl has
won the last twelve meetings, often
by absurd margins, the AFC's best
hope lies in the fact that the Buffalo
Bills did not even make the playoffs
this year. The Bills have made an art
out of losing the Super Bowl each of
the last four years, and appear to have
cleared the path for another AFC
team to get blown out of the water.
Thus, if you want the pick of these
two authors this game probably won't
last much past the first half. In the

two teams' previous

meeting this
49ers edged out the Chargers by a final score of 38-19. The
49ers dominated that game and have
only improved in recent weeks. The
result of the game being Vferegone
year, the

conclusion, thereal question becomes
whether the Chargers will beat the
twenty point spread. In our estimation, the answer is a definitive "Yes."
The Chargers are led by all world
linebacker Junior Seau who anchors
their highly ranked defense. On offense, the gritty folk hero Stan
Humphries promises to be a force
throwing the ball although the question is to whom. Although Humphries
has had control problems in the past,
he has blossomed in recent weeks

inspiring his teammates and the
City of San Diego with gutsy performances in the face of serious injuries
and a season filled with adversity.
Yet perhaps the single most important catalyst for the Charger offense will be the play of one Natrone
Means. Means, who will turn twentytwo in the spring, and already has two
NFL seasons under his belt, has been
nicknamed the "Natrone Bomb" by
fans and foes alike for his brutish
power and deceptive speed. If Means
can penetrate the as yet untested
middle front lineof the 49er defense,
thenthe Chargers will be able to open
their playbook and explore every
package. In the authors' estimation,
after

a 100+ yard performance by

Means
should guarantee that the Chargers
will cover the spread (to repeat, there
is no way for the Chargers to win the
game).

Finally, the city of San Diego is
hungry for a championship. These
players know they are the underdogs
and carry the hopes and dreams ofall
young San Diegans on their burly
shoulders. To use a cliche, they have
nothing to lose.
By contrast, the 49ers have everything to lose. Steve Young has been
hauntedby the ghost of Joe Montanna
and despite being the best quarterback of the 19905, only a Super Bowl
XXIX ring will assure his place in the
pantheon of great players of all time.
In addition, failure in the big game
could cost George Siefert, the classy
coach of the 49ers, his job. Finally,
as so many have predicted a stunning
49er victory, anything shortofablowout could be seen as a disappointment In short, the pressure rests
squarely on the San Francisco 49ers.
On campus, the frenzied excitement is barely palpable. Charger and
49er partisans appear few in number,
and the large Tampa Bay contingent
appears as yet uncommitted to either
team. Nonetheless, as the SuperBowl
is regularly the most watched sporting event in the world, even apathetic
Swarthmore students tend to tune in

Brianßattle'9s,commented,

"On any given day, any NFL team
can beat any other. However, this is
not such a given day. San Francisco
will defeat San Diego 35-13." Ben
Schall '97 noted "Ahh yeah!!! San
Francisco 52, San Diego 5."
As for the predictions of the authors, we think the smart money is
on San Diego to beat the point spread.
