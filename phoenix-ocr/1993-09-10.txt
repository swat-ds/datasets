students. Some students principally those
who own their own computers and live in
dormrooms have direct, immediate, and 24hour access to the Internet, one of the world's
richest and most diverse sources of information.
Others
those who live off-campus,
don't own computers, or are intimidated by
the technology have significantly different
access. To be sure, they have all the same
capabilities, and even a bit more, in the public
areas. But faculty and other students must
bear in mindthat a significant and unknown
portion of the student body does not have a
full network connection.
The other side of the division among
faculty and students is what Downing calls
the "lust of the superuser for more and more
and more." Late last year, a minor controversy erupted when it became clear that the
Computing Centerintended to stop providing
two resources: direct access to a Unix operating environment and telephone dial-in lines
to that system.
The two services, while admittedly used
by a minority of the college community, were
of particular importance to two
groups: "superusers" and off-campus students. The ensuing controversy displayed the
essential conflict for the Computing Center:
how much energy to put into providing frills
for the'average user' as opposed to providing
basic services for those who don't fit the
mold.
For many years, the college's virtual
Macintosh-only policy left non-Mac users
free to do their thing, albeit without College
support. Now, though, that possibility is
changing. In a sense, the Computing Center
is becoming the victim ofits own success; by
creating a campus culture ever more dependent on technology and telecommunications,
it has made the climate increasingly difficult
for students who do not fit thebasic model of
on-campus Macintosh users.
The challenge for thenext few years will
be how to integrate the "margins" of the
Swarthmore College community off-campus students, non-deskboundemployees, nonMacintosh users, "superusers," perhaps even
faculty and students overseas into a truly
impressive telecommunicationsand information system.
In case you were wondering, my seminar
decided to go mainly with the traditional
paper-and-folder model of seminar communication. We had at least one student who was
clearly uncomfortable with e-mail technology, two off-campus students with substandard access to e-mail, and several seminar
members who preferred operating systems
other than Macintosh. Maybe next year....
-

In myfirst seminar we spent almost a half
hour deciding to what extent to use the
College's new telecommunicationsinfrastructure for communication among the members
of the seminar. Would we e-mail theseminar
papers? Communicate via a folder on the
Classes server? Or would we stick with the
traditional photocopy and file-box method?
The significance of the telecommunications revolution taking place on campus this
year will escape few students.
Every on-campus studenthas a telephone
and a voicemailbox ofhis or her own that's
right, five phones in a quint! bringing a
quick, if not particularly easy, end to the days
of message boards, lost messages, and busy
signals.
Perhaps more interesting, though, is the
expansionofthecampus network and thereby
the worldwide Internet network.
The introduction two yearsago of a POPbased electronic mail system (known to its
usersas Eudora) as the campus standardmade
e-mail the preferred mode of communication
at Swarthmore. The extension of the network
that makes Eudora useful means e-mail and
otherinformational services will be available
to students 24 hours a day provided they
have computers in theirrooms to take advantage of the technology.
Alongside e-mail, students have access
to Gopher, numerous libraries, huge archives
of software and information, and other data
sources. The academic and social uses of
theseconnections can hardly be overstated.
Judy Downing, Director of Information
Services, is concerned that theexistence ofthe
new technology on campus will create a rift
between those who use and understand the
systems and those who don't. The split, she
says, "was totally created by technology."
According to Downing, there are two
competing implications of the increasing email use on campus. Faculty and students
concerned with excessive use of paper have
criticized the continued use ofpaper mailings.
But Downing points out that an important
section of the campus community dining
services, housekeeping, and physical plant
workers do not have ready access to campus
network resources.
"How can we say that our preferred means
of communication on this campus is e-mail
when... the people who do not have access to
the technology get left out?"
Every faculty and staff member has a
Macintosh on her or his desk, says Downing.
But "we have another constituency out there:"
a constituency of College employees whose
jobs are not behind desks.
A similar split exists among groups of

Assault groups restructure programs
ASAP, Survivors, Friends of Survivors plan for the year
By Eli Rubin
Survivors, Friends of Survivors, and the
Acquaintance Sexual Assault PreventionProgram (ASAP) have plans to alter their formats and schedules significantly. Survivors
and Friends of Survivors, both groups dealing with victims of sexual assault, plan to
increase the variety and size of the groups'
activities. ASAP is considering producing a
newer, updated video for their orientation
workshops.
Survivors and Friends of Survivors codirectors Mike Rothbart '94 and Suzannah
Cole '94 have plans to develop a sexual
assault library at Swarthmore, create a training program for students interested in being
escorts for other students who feel that they
are being sexually harassed or threatened,
recruit increased faculty and staff participation, hold an "open house" meeting at Bond
on Sept. 21st at 7:30 p.m. to discuss the issue
of sexual assault, and more, including reviving Survivor's Week. Coleand Rothbart stress
that they are also contact people for the
Survivor's support group. Cole's number is
x3346, and Rothbart's is 544-4877.
"Last year Mike [Rothbart] and I basically didSurvivor's Week...—and we weren't
even the coordinators. It basically didn't
happen," said Cole. Survivor's Week, when
members ofthe Survivors support group and
the Friends of Survivors group concentrate
their efforts into raising awareness about
sexual assault, will be greatly expanded and
rejuvenated this year.
"We're changing thedatesofSurvivor's
Week from the spring, when it was last year,

last year were concentrating on final exams,
and those whodid come to the activities left

Official announcement
On Friday morning, May 21,1993, a
Dean's Committeemet to consider a complaint brought by a department of the
faculty against a student. The student was
charged with eavesdropping and attempting to record a confidential meeting of the
faculty department. The member of the
Dean's Committee were Peter Schmidt,
Tyrene White, David Allgieier, Tanya
Byker, and Eric McCrath; the observer
was Tedd Goundie. The Committee was
convened by Ngina Lythcott.
The student admitted to the charges
prior to the hearing. A hearing ofthe facts
of the case was held in order to reaffirm a
finding of guilt and to better inform the
Committee's sanction discussion. The
Committee deliberated in executive session in order to determine an appropriate
sanction.
The Dean's Committee decided on
the following sanctions:
First, the student must make a public
apology to faculty members in the department and to the department majors who
are seniors. Second, while the student
may participate in the activities during the
week leading up to and including graduation, he may not participate in either the
baccalaureate or commencement ceremonies. He may receive his degree at some
agreed upon time after the ceremony.

Reflections on the Dedication of the
U.S.Holocaust Memorial Museum
While the dedication of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum occurred
last spring, the controversy surrounding the event-like all things in the nation's capitalremains a topic offervent discussion. "Where does it belong?" "Why does it belong?"
Similarly, thoughts of this very debatefilled many of my otherwise empty summer days.
"We don't buy the Holocaust lie! We don't buy the Holocaust lief"
This was thechant thatcontinued-at timesfor minutes on end-from the early morning
until mid-afternoon on April 22, justfifty yards awayfrom what was decreed one of the
largest international events in recent memory: the dedication ceremony of the United
States HolocaustMemorialMuseum. At the dedication were President Clinton and Vice
President Gore, the democratically elected Heads-of-State ofvirtually every nation, and
members of the United States Holocaust Memorial Council. Also present at the
dedicationwere Holocaust survivors, friends and loved ones ofvictims, as well as nearly
two thousand benefactors.
Not all were able to stay and witness the tribute, however. As I walked about taking
pictures for my personal scrapbook, I saw a gentleman give his ticket (in the sitting
section, no less) to a woman, a complete stranger, saying "I've been through all of this
in 1944...I can't go through this again." I wasn't certain ifhe was referring to the NeoNazi and white supremacist protesters, or the actual gravity of the dedication and the
museum itself. (Indeed, for many present at the dedication, the dayproved bittersweet
at best.) At any rate, I was certain he wasn't referring to the horrible weatherand nearly
freezing temperature.
Spending the day listening to individuals such as ElieWiesel (Founding Chair ofthe
USJIM. Council), TedKoppel (Master ofCeremonies, whoseparents are survivors of
the Holocaust), a retelling of EdwardR.Murrow's "Broadcastfrom Buchenwald," and
President Clinton himselffocused my thinking upon one of my favorite writers, James
Baldwin, and the universality ofhis statement that "To accept one's past-one's historyis not the same thing as drowning in it; it is learning how to use it."
The refusal on the part of white supremacists to accept history-namely the Holocaust-serves to strip away the identity of Jews worldwide, but especially here in America,
where ties to one's cultural past function as a crucial source of our national consciousness. Were white supremacists truly willing to ignore the tragedy of the Holocaust?
AgainI remembered Baldwin's phrase, and began to think ofthe refusal to acknowledge
theHolocaust as not simply a free choice, but as an oppressive strategy to deny people
an importantpart of their history-a history that is not only there to give witness, but also
to educate. On April 22, that sentiment was expressed eloquently by Harvey M.
Meyerhoff, current Chair of the U.SJIM. Council:
"This museum was builtfor Americans who...may not have confronted their knowledge
of history's most tragic event in a way that impacts their everyday experience. It is our
intent that all visitors to the Museum will leave not just with knowledge, but with the
determination to speak out and act against injustice and racism and the denial of basic
human rights, and to make that commitment apart of theirlives."

Who Framed Roger Rabbit and
The Untouchables get thumbs up

By Adam Blakelev and

the movie review. I'm here with my roommate Will, and let me just say first off that it's
a damn good thing I am. No more will we
have to hear intolerant persecution towards
those bearing my name. Enough said.
Will Buttram: Adam, go back to bed.
This week, we're actually going to review the
upcoming movies. Why, we've even watched
the movies. Recently. Really. I'm not
kidding.
A: So anyway, this weekend, the Movie

—W.B.
Committee has brought us two 30's "gangster" movies. On Friday at 7:30 & 10 there's
The Untouchables and on Saturday Who
Framed Roger Rabbit? Both are showing at
the PAC.
W: Nice theater.
A: Indeed.
W: Don'tyou think it's a bit of a stretch
to call Roger Rabbit a gangster mov... oops,
wait. Pizza's here. Be right back.
W: OK, we're back. Let's get to the
reviews. First of all, The Untouchables is a
beautifully shot, extremely violent movie.
Your basic Law vs. Gangster flick.
A: But it's a bit deeper than that. As
important as the plot is the moral journey that
Eliot Ness, played by Kevin Costner, takes
through the film.
W: Costner actually does a fine job as
Ness. It's one of the few movies in which he
acts.

Todd Sasaki: What about The Bodyguard?
W: Exactly my point
A: I think the opening credits set up the
movie very well. The first shotis of shadows;
as the camera pulls back, the title of the
movie, which refers to Ness' crime-fighting
unit, is revealed. Focusing on theshadows is
appropriate because of the increasingly questionablemethodsNess uses to catch Capone.
W: Speaking ofCapone,Robert DeNiro
is a genius. But we hardly needed to tell you
that His suits are gorgeous, by the way—all
the costuming was done by Giorgio Armani.
A: It's actually a very close call to say
who was the best actor in this movie—DeNiro
as Capone or Sean Connery as a beat cop
turned Ness' mentor.
W: So far, we agree on everything. But
I think you had some problems with the
ending?
A: Yeah, at heart I have a real problem
with the some of the moral decisions Ness
makes. Particularly one, which I won't mention.
W: Ipersonally don't think I would have
been satisfied with any other ending. And I
think Ness' decision was necessary for Brian
DePalma (who does an exquisite directing

job) to make his point.
A: I still disagree—l thought it was a bit
too much.
W: Cool, but let's just mention Andy
Garcia's fine portrayal of the fiery rookie cop
before we get on to Roger Rabbit.
A: Agreed. One last point—the movie
has one of the most moving (some might say
cheesy, but I disagree) death scenes I've ever
seen.

W: So anyway, on to Roger and Jessica
Rabbit.
Andy Heyman: Particularly Jessica.
W: Calm your hormones. This movie is
JUST PLAIN FUN! I love it.
T: You know, there's a scene in it that's
shot right by my house.
A: What, in Toonstown?
T: (pouts)
W: So Adam, what did you think?
A: I thought the existentialist subtext
was a tad obtuse.
W: Yes, a tad.
A: Right, well anyway, you can't say
much intellectual about this film, which is
exactly what we, at Swat, need.
W: That doesn't mean it's not high art,
though. It's one of the finest pieces of cartoon
literature, and of comedy as far as I'm concerned. (Close second to Aladdin.)
A: I think Roger says it all whenhe tells
Bob Hoskins (excellent), "Laughter can be a
pretty powerful thing... sometimes it's the
only thing we have." A very good point:
humor is a highly underrated aspect of life.
W: Incidentally, pay close attention to
the background in this film. Just about every
cartoon character you've ever known has a
cameo.
T: Seriously, in the bridge scene...
A: Right Furthermore, this movie deserves the highest praise I can thinkoffor its
combination of human and cartoon actors.
Superbly acted, drawn, and edited.
W: Well, we're almost near the end, but
let me mention the soundtracks. Both are
amazing. Pay particular attention to the opening credits ofThe Untouchables as well as the

InRogerRabbit, all ofthe music is really slick

A: To wrap this up, we both urgeyou to

refreshing, three-course meal; but nevertheless, it's the nectar of the gods. (By the way,

true in countries where refrigeration is considered a luxury, it has been known to happen

But life isn't all fun and games, so on to
more important topics:

Prickly heat
ah!-fliction
By Katy Menzer

My entirebody, fromhead to sweaty toe,
is covered withprickly heat. Yes, PRICKLY
HEAT. I wonder if all you Pennsylvanian/
Eastern Pacific/ New Englanders have any
idea of what I am writing about or even the
magnitude of my plight If you haven't met
me, you might think that prickly heat is the
latest scented massage oil produced by The
Body Shop. If you have met me, you most
likely believe that the prickly heat is Xavier
Robert's last feeble attempt to recapture the
glory of theCabbage PatchKids ofyore (ooh,
nasty thought there, kiddoes). Well, it matters
not, for in either case, you are wrong.
The prickly heat is, in fact, the eleventh
plague brought about to punish the infidel,
every Southerner's other-worldly reminder
that there is a hell, the political equivalent to
George Bush being elected to another four
years in office, and which is gosh dam itchy.
I write, of course, ofheat rash.
In my formerly naive days beforefreshmen orientation, I believed that prickly heat
was a purely 18th century Southern tradition.
Although I'd never personally had the rash,
my grandmother had told me of the days of the

yourself, leave the Air Jordans at home.
INTERNATIONALTERRORISM: An
unpleasant topic, but one that should be mentioned. My best advice is 1) fly Quant as
(what would JoeTerrorist want with a bunch
of Aussies?) and 2) stay away from places
like Belfast. Of course, I mention Belfast
because I went there, and let me tell you, the
fact that men in camouflage patrolled the
street with M-16's to serve and protect was
not terriblycomforting. Thankfully, there are
guidebooks for such areas of the worldwhich
give you a few precautionary measures you
can take to minimize the threat of impending
violence, such as ducking every few minutes
or so. Another useful tip I picked up is that if
all of a sudden everyone around you starts
screaming and running in a certain direction,
follow them. That may sound a bit overly
cautious, particularly toyouNew Yorkers out
there; but it's justpossible they know something you don't.
ACADEMICS: No, no, I'm justkidding.
FOOD: This varies a bit from place to
place, so all I can do is say that if you go to
Ireland, prepare to lose some weight. There
are only so many ways in which apotato may
be prepared so that one would actually be
motivated to eat it.
Well, that's about it. I really did come

Assorted ramblings of a slightly disoriented freshman, even after orientation

heat, actually were too busy to ogle Miss
Kitty's breasts at every opportunity.
However, upon reaching Swarthmore, I
have discoveredthat my provincial beliefthat
heat rash only occurred in the South was
sorely mistaken. I know now that I was
wrong, for here I sit in a dorm room in the
great state of Pennsylvania withmy first case
of prickly heat, a case that would surely kill a
weaker person.
So, now that youknow whatprickly heat
is, perhaps you are wondering how I, a true
Texan, could have never experienced this
affliction previously. I can answer you simply with two words: air-conditioning.
You see, even in the backward and barbaric areas of the South, we have somehow
been able to obtain the technology to design
and manufacture air-conditioning units. Everything is air-conditioned in Texas: houses,
supermarkets, mini-malls, port-a-potties,
EVERYTHING. It is for this reason that I
could not believeit when I was unpacking my
full length winter coat and my ice skates in the
spacious interior ofmy Willets' dorm room
and I was toldthat there was no air-conditioning in the building. I had merely assumed that
the college had not turned on the a/c yet. But
I was wrong.
So here I continue to sit, coated in a thick
layer ofperspiration, and sticking uncomfortably to my chair. I believe that lam being
punished for all my incorrect assumptions
about theNorth. But allmy hope is not yet lost
for a friend of mine, who is also of Dallas
origin, is taking a meteorology course at
Swarthmore and he swears that we will soon
be the gratefulrecipients ofcool and variable
winds. Wait! He's only been taking the
course for how many days?...

A First Year's Top Ten Swat Questions:
10. Are the fire alarms set to go off when
I am in the shower?
9. Is the 500% humidity in Sharpies
meant to make us nauseous in order for the
school to spend less money on food?
8. How come a $4OO million dollar
endowment can only afford two air-conditioned buildings (and one Admissions Office)?
7. If Quinn Bauriedel (RA) can dance up
a disco storm and receive a standing ovation,
why does a freshman dance bring in 1/
1,000,000of our class?
6. An all campus party with six or eight
kegs brings out 200 Swatties on a Friday
night????
5. Are we so isolated in between Philadelphia and nowhere that a Saturday without
working on your homework means you sat
around playing cards or got lost in the library
searching for a book that was on General
Reserve (and you didn't know what that
meant)?
4. Did Al Bloom come back from
California's beautiful weather because the
President's house is reeeeaaaallllllly nice or
does he enjoy the layer ofmoisture mat drips
down the length ofhis body every day for the
first month of school?
3. Was theFox TV Show "Class of '96"
filmed at Swarthmore or was it "Head of the
Class"? (I'd guess the latter.)
2. Does Swarthmore College monopolize the ville so much that the return of students begins a major airline-type price-cutting war between the restaurant giants:
Alfredo's and Swarthmore Pizza?
1. Why does everyone still have message boards on their walls when Swat spent
thousands of dollars to give you a personal
voice mail system?
0. If we can't rememberall our numbers
(P.O. Box, MAC Card, Long Distance Code,
VoiceMail code, E-mail address, E-mail password, room number, locker number, locker
combo, average SAT score, number of days
in a work week (should befive or less)), do we

still belong here?
-1. Were ASAP workshops funded by
the CIA to stop overpopulation?
-2. Amlreally still a worthwhileperson?
Answers to any ofthese question should
be put into Box 1250 for printing in a later
issue. As I attempt to rid myself of the
disoriented feeling I have after orientation, I
realize that I will always be able to reminisce
about Camp Swarthmore, even after I stampede through the first 1,000,000,000,000,000
pages ofreading.
Now as I return to my books (30ofthem),

the first day of class, I think how lucky I am

and liberalism with humidity on its way out.
I wonder whether the University of Hawaii
wouldhave been a betterchoice. (I guess notthey don't play Wink.)
Next week: I grapple with the questions...

is it a bunch of specs here for an extended
visit?
2. Did lightning really hit the Credit
Union or were angry seniors trying to erase
their loans?

So this is Swarthmore?
By Ben Salter
News flash!! Entire entering class at
Swarthmore College melts! Students must
be carried to class in buckets! Highlights at
ten.

Well, that's what the first day here felt
like to me. I'm from Colorado, where the
water stays in the rivers and lakes whereit's
supposed to be and doesn't hang around in
theair to suffocate people. Killer humidity,
and then a cataclysmic storm that night. The
weather seemed to be an ominous sign of
disapproval. Sweltering in a sea ofsweating
Swarthmore students did not seem a promising start to my collegiate career.
Here I was, thousands of miles from
home, in a place that no one had heard of and
right outside of a city that everyone had
warned me about. All of theupperclassmen,
skin pallid and eyes sunken in from hundreds of hours of work, were warning us
about what a hard time we were in for in the
next four years. What was I doing here?
I found my answer in my stark, white,
institutional-style room in Hallow ell, in the
seductive voice at the other endof my telephone line. The sultry, although somewhat
tiny and mechanical, voice of this goddess
was talking directly to me, asking my name
and a secret password to use justbetween us.
Unlike pretty much all of the females that I
have met, this one came with an instruction
manual. Even though it was complex and
intimidating at first, there it was, a step by
step flow-chart on how to get along withmy
long-distance love interest. If only all relationships could be that way.

And then, once I finally got it, there
was my computer —worlds better than the
old dinosaur that I had at home. It would
smile at me whenI turned it on and welcome
me to its operating system. Then it would
politely tell me that I was an idiot, and
couldn't drag my hard-driveinto the trash,
or open ten files at a time, or get into a
specific file. And then, just as politely, it
would inform me that one of the files that I
was working on had quit, and it had no idea
why, and that I had better just deal with it
and stop yelling at it or it would file for a
restraining order. Well, at least it was polite.
So, here I am, going through the first
few days of classes, syllabi busily eating
away at myfree time, work piling up on me
and my friends, and all of us gleefully finding excuses not to do it Now this is more
like it
And of course, to break the monotony
of our busy schedulesoftrying to find things
we want to do and avoiding things that we
have to do, we have the wonderful harmonious sound of the volunteer fire department
siren, which sounds much like the mating
call of a deranged stork blasted over a loud
speaker. This device might be fairly effective for fire prevention, as people try to
avoid starting fires just so they will be
spared thathorrendous sound.
And, last but not least we have the
gourmet cuisine ofSharpies. Tons of variety offood that all tastes the same. We feel
bad about not eating, because we paid for it,
but we feel even worse after eating, because
we actually paid for it

Returning women's
ruggers ready for action
Team expects one of the best seasons in years
By Scott Williams
The 1993 Women's Rugby
looking forward to an exciting season this fall with skilled and
experiencedplayers guiding a strong
cast of newcomers. The club returns largely intact, having only lost
two seniors, and is confident of surpassing the .500 mark in the coming
weeks.
The women's rugby team has
shown continued improvement in
the past four years, winning more
games each season and proving to
be a growing threat to major rivals
such as Bryn Mawr/Haverford and
Princeton. Last year, Swat rugby
lost by a narrow margin to these
teams in the playoffs, eventually
defeating U Perm to take fifth place.
Co-captains JennieRomich'94 and
Delta Ruscheinsky'9s look forward
to this year's playoff match-ups,
citing both the high level of experience in the largely upper-class team
and the raw talent and determination they see in the younger players.
"Two years ago we really relied on one or two star players to
make things happen, but now we
have such depth of experience that
everyone out there knows how to
make things happen. I'm appreciativeofall the upper-class leadership
on the field," says Romich.

scored three goals in thefirst fifteen
minutes of the second half to take
the lead. The unrelenting rain and
Swarthmore offense overwhelmed
Wilkes and Swat's defense provided vital support by holding
Wilkes to only four shots on goal.
This followed their first victory of the season, a shutout at
Goucher on Monday, September 6.
Senior captain Miriam Marx
scored once and had one assist
against Wilkes.
Another veteran, Sandy
Schmidt'94, came forward to score
from the fullback position. Rachael
Johnson, a junior, racked up a goal
and an assist. MadelineFraser '95
also scoredtwice. Coach Goetcheus
praises her women for constantly
attacking the ball and for their good
communication on the field.
With 2 wins, the team has already matched last season's win total. The team and the coaches are
confident that they will break .500
this fall.
On the weekend of the eleventh and twelfth of September, the
women's soccer team meets Misericordia and University of Detroit. Coach Goetcheus is not sure
what to expect from these teams
because Swat has yet to play them.
She has confidence in her team's
cohesiveness and believes that it

notes the play
of the three
first-year students, Lauren Jacobi, Sarah Luger,
and JillRubin. The coach noted that
the first-years' assertive play keeps
the veterans on their toes, thusforcing superior performances from
each player. Coming into this season, women's soccer lost only three
starters. This season's co-captains,
Miriam Marx, Jennifer Ekert' 94,
and Danica Bloomquist '94 fill in
the leadership positions.
Coach Goetcheus maintains
that positive interactionoff the field

the field. Starter Lauren Jacobi '97
asserts that women's soccer at Swar

and she is "confident that the
women's soccer program will be
successful" this season. As a new
member Lauren "feels very accepted" and sheholds thatthe"soccer
team is almost like a family."
Four players are injured currently, but Goetcheusremains confident that her team can challenge
its perennial rivals like Haverford,
Bryn Mawr, and Dickinson. Although Goetcheus understands the
wealth of academic and extra-curricular responsibility S watties have,
she wishes she couldhave more fan

Unfortunately, it took a little

According to Nebelsieck, Swat
"came out flat," and "was too hesitant the entire first half."
These sentiments were echoed

According to team statistician
Chris Marin '96, Kean's only goal
in the first half was a weak one.
Said Marin, "The keeper,
Shawn Bundy '97, got a hand on the
ball as he was moving over to stop
it. But the ball was just hard enough
to go in. It was almostlike a fluke."
According to Bundy, "He shot
to my right and I justcaught a piece
of it. It just dribbled in. If I had
stopped it we might have had a
chance to win the game."
Though down, Swat came out
strong at half-time, and playedKean
to a standstill for the second half.

According
Marin,"againstS.U.N.Y. Pottsdam,
the defense was outstanding. We
only allowed four shots the whole
game, and we controlled the ball
muchof the time —just asKean had
done to us."
Bundy heartily agreed. "The
guys played good defense agsinst
Pottsdam. They blocked a lot of
shots for me, so that I just didn't
have to face many. I thinkthat they
weren't as intimidated as they were
against Kean."
The team played solidly in the
first half, but really shined in the
second half. Nathan Fairman '94,
assisted by Jay Rose '95, put the
team ahead 1-0 in the first half. In
the second half, Fairman and Rose

on a breakaway and was tripped
from behind, and scored on a penalty kick.
"We played much better against
Pottsdam. We had a lot ofchances
in the first half, and opened up the
second halfwith three goals in about
threeminutes. I was especially impressive when Kyle came in right
off the bench and scored with a
header. He was pretty happy about
that," according to Jacobs.
After this weekend's performances, it looks as if the team has a
good chance to do well this season.
If the team is able to put together its
offense and defense as it did in the
Pottsdam game,it has a lotof potential. However, winning will mean
avoiding defensive lapses that might
cause the team to fall needlessly
behind in close games. It will take
some work to develop greater consistency in the backfieid.

As defendingchampions of the
Seven Sisters Tournament, the
women's volleyball team takes the
court for their season opener Friday, September 10, at Wilmington
College. Hoping to continue an
unbeaten streak that began with the
second half of last season, Swat
looks forward to thereturn of Jenny
Willis '94, who spent a semester
away, and is described by co-captain Katie Westin 494 as the "best
all-around player" on the team.
The Seven Sisters Tournament
includes Tri-College rivals Haverford and Bryn Mawr, plus Vassar,
Mount Holyoke, Smith, and
Wellesley. "[To repeat as champions] is one of our great goals," explained Rachel McKaig '95. That
Swat won lastyear without Willis is
a testament to the depth that has
now become the hallmark of the
team.

"I feel we have really deep hitting... ten or twelve women can really hit hard," said Westin. While
this year's team is a large squad
with 19players, 12of whom are on
the travel squad, "Everyone [on the
travel squad] is strong enough to
start," added co-captain Way-Ting
Chen 4 94
As a result of this depth, competition has been really tough for
the six starting jobs. "Competition
is kind of intense this year... we
have five seniors on the team," said
Westin, "[and the] sophomores and
juniors are fighting to retain spots
they won last year while the seniors
were away."
Most of the experienced players are hitters, but as all sports fans
know, few games are all-offense.
Digging

is "the part 01 the defense

that is still being formed," admitted
Westin. In addition, the team needs
at least one setter on the court at all
times, and the three setters on the
team are relatively inexperienced
compared to the hitters.
"With the loss of four-year setter Wendy Cheung '93, the team
sorely needed someone to step up in
the setting position," said Matt
Schenk '95, a team manager. "I
think Diana [Bieber '96], Kaori
[Shingledecker 96], and Vilma
[Huertas '94] are showing great
potential in this area."
Schenk and John Voss '96, the
other team manager, are both members of the men's volleyball club

There is a closebondbetween
the women's team and the men's
club, whosemembers often come to
practice with the women to give
them experience digging harder hit
balls. During the men's season,
"we do the same for them, but they
[Schenk and Voss] get paid and we
don't," joked Chen.
The team is not only excited
about its depth butalso about Coach
Dale Strawbridge, who has been
with the team since 1984. "[He] has
made a genuine effort to be supportive and encouraging," said Westin.
Coaching is a very important
aspect of the women's game because of the largerole given to specialty players. Keeping track of
substitutions to ensure the proper
mix of players is on the court is a
daunting job. "[There are] more
players then we can actually use,"
admitted Chen.
This year Swat is playing in a
newly formed league, the Centennial Conference, which includes
Haverford, Bryn Mawr, Western
Maryland, Franklin and Marshall,
Washington College, Dickinson,
Gettysburg, Muhlenberg, Johns
Hopkins, and Ursinus. Thepurpose
of joining this league, which replaced the Mid-AtlanticConference,
is to put Swat in a position where
"we're playing colleges with the
same focus [as Swat]... [who] don't
offer athletic scholarships," said
Westin.
Despite not being able to offer
athletic scholarships, the women's
team has still attracted many great
athletes. Included as players to
watch by Westin were hitters Chen,
Willis, McKaig, and Nancy
Rosenbaum '96 and diggers Willis

Swat has a grueling 19 match
schedule which includes two tournaments, the Seven Sisters Tournament and the Cabrini Tournament.
The Sisters Tournament is in early

which Swat hasn't played in for a
couple of years, is the week after,
immediately before October break.
Unfortunately, Swat's first
home game is not until September

Swat field hockey dominates in opener
By Tina Shepardson
Swarthmore's field hockey
team outplayed their rivals for an

impressive 4-0 shutout in
Thursday's game against Kings.
The fans as well as the players
were excited to get the season off to
a good start As one fan commented
after the game, "Looks like it's going to be a good year, eh?"
A good year indeed, if
Thursday's game was any indication. Swat clearly dominated the
game, keeping Kings on the defensive for most of the game (which
took place in spite of the imminent
threat of rain, and the fact that a
large sprinkler was obstinately watering the intended game field).
This year's team is made up
largely of first-year students; but
that is not to say that the team will
need a few years before it is a
competitve force! Many of these
new students were starters in the

game, and it was SamPeltz from the
class of '97 who scored thefirst and
only goal of the first half.
The first half of the game was
punctuated again and again by
Swat's shots on goal. One of the
team's three captains, Melissa
Bonder '95, repeatedly drove the
ball up thefield for shotson goal. As
another spectator commented, "It's
a tough game for [Kings'] goalie!"
Mira Seo '95 and team captain
Emily Smith '94 also played very
strongly in the game. Seo was an
aggressive force on the field, and
Smith continually zipped around
several players to bring theball further up the field. "She's short, but
she's swift!" Rachel Meyers '94
said of Smith.
Swat, with a 1-0 lead at the
half, came out fighting as Smith
made an impressive drive toward
Kings' goal. Unfortunately, however, Swat once again had trouble
finishing the drive with a score. A

few tense moments followed as the
ball drifted back down to Swat's
defense, and even our goal. The
threat vanished innocuously, however, as Swat, lead by sweeper and
team captain Jane Grabias '94, returned the ball to the safety of the
other end of the field.
The game continuedwithKelly
Wilcox '97,LiaEmst '97 and Becky
Bush '96 all making strong offensive plays. Bonder lead the offense
as time after time she pummelled
Kings' goalie with her powerful
shots. Kings' goalie put up a valiant
effort, but Swat's offense was unrelenting, and Bonder eventually
scored the second goal of the game.
Swat sealedthe gamewith two
more goals in thefinal ten minuites.
Bonder scored a third goal for Swat,
which was followed less than a
minute later with another goal by
Peltz!Fans and players alike leftthe
field pleased with the 4-0 shutout,
and hopeful for the team's future.
