Earthlust calls
for moratorium
on shower sex
BY DEE CONNER

1-900-WET-N-WLD

In response to the declaration of a statewide drought
last month, members of Earthlust have called for a moratorium on shower sex, citing statistics that show that a
running shower is the most popular place for students
with roommates to have sex.
"We ask that students here and at other colleges like
Haverford, Bryn Mawr and the University of Pennsylvania
reconsider the shower as a place for getting it on,"
Earthlust member Gaia Wyn-Power 'O2 said. "Oh, wait.
Scratch that. I forgot that Haverford kids never get any. At
any rate, shower sex wastes 3.5 billion gallons of water
every year in the greater Philadelphia area. Please, people,
try to take your activities elsewhere!"
The "Stop Shower Sex Now" campaign will include useless tabling at Sharpies and droplet-shaped ribbons that
concerned students can wear to show that they have taken
a vow to abstain from under-the-nozzle nookie. The cam-

Admissions lies
BY SETH SIAS
1-900-ADMIT-ME
In a scandal that has rocked the college community,
the admissions office has admitted to doctoring a photo

in its new brochure. Some are already compaing it to a
similar incident at the University of Wisconsin, where
admissions officials inserted the face of a black student
into a photo of a sporting event he never attended.
The Swarthmore photo in question appears to show
all of our favorite ville businesses: Occasionally Yours,
Renato's, Sitar Palace
wait a minute, Sitar Palace?
Anyone looking at the brochure can clearly see that
someone in admissions cut steadfast ville business
Finlandia out of the picture and replaced it with the chic
Philly Indian restaurant.
"Sitar Palace may not be physically in Swarthmore,
but so many students eat there that it is part of our community, and we wanted to express that in our brochure,"
Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid Jim Bock '9O said.
"Anyway, our ville is much nicer than the real one. I
mean, who shops at Finlandia anyway?"
However, some admitted students were not pleased to
learn of the deception. "I applied early decision after
signing a contract that said I would not lie on my appli-

cation," a disgruntled Ima Prospect 'O6 said. "I never considered the possibility that the college would be the one
to lie."
"Gotcha there!" a jubilant, slightly chagrined Bock
said with a gleam in his eye.
Some raised the concern that distorting Swarthmore's
image in this manner strayed from the college's Quaker
heritage of honesty and, more importantly, intrinsic
drugery.
"Oh, no, Lucretia Mott doctored photos all the time,"
Bock said defensively. "The Sharpies family even 'doctored' its name," he said, making quote signs with his fingers for emphasis and referring to the change in the families' spelling of its name.
"The truly heinous aspect of this incident is the possibility that next year's entering freshmen might think we
have interesting social lives," Rhee Signer 'O3, Student
Council co-president, said.
Another photo shows an unrealistic array of
Swarthmore students gathered around a tandoori oven.
All five students are dressed in new J. Crew outfits and
appear tanned, toned and clean.
"Hey, you never know
maybe if we put attractive,
clean people on the brochure, they will start applying,"
Bock said, looking earnest.

Phoenix receieves NC for semester

in an unprecedented move, the
deans announced yesterday that they
would begin giving grades to student
activities, effective this semester.
"We felt that subjecting student
groups to the same level of scrutiny
as academics level would be the best

extracurriculars here," Dean of the
College Bob Gross '62 said. "What
better way to attract prospective students than making student activities
as overachieving as everything else?
I mean, dun!"
Under the new plan, the college
would issue "shadow grades," much
like first-semester freshmen receive,
for this semester.
After leveling accusations of pla-

giarism and academic dishonesty at
The Phoenix last week, the deans
said in a statement Wednesday that
The Phoenix would receive a "No
Credit" for its work this semester.
The deans noted that since none of
the editors of The Phoenix could be
sanctioned, the only appropriate
response that remained was to place

themed Pub Nite with draught beer.
Ngo Knooky, spokesman for the Delaware River Basin
Commission, supported the campaign during a speech at
its opening awareness rally. "We ask people not to take
that long a shower and not to let the tap run during bathroom activities," he said.
Some underclassmen took issue with the campaign. "I
have nowhere else to go!" wailed Mona Lott 'O5. "My roommate sexiles me every weekend, and at least with shower
sex I can kill two birds with one stone."
But some students feel the measure is too harsh. "You
can be environmentally conscious and still have sex in the
shower," said Lou L'amour 'O4. "I mean, just turn it off
until it's time to get soaped up. What's so hard about that?"

Dee Conner Who else does all the work around here?

its point of view. According to its charter, members
will forego all water-related activities, including
showering, and will drink only organic free-trade

Shocking new audio records may have shed new light on the true reason for the athletics cuts ofDecember 2000. The tapes of that fateful Board of Managers meeting reveal
that a massive drug binge and orgy may have influenced the so-called decision-making
process. If true, this accounts for President Al Bloom's flustered countenance and
inability to explain the decision amid the uproar in the days that followed.
The three hours of audio indicate that opium smoking, heroin injections, cocaine
snorting and group sex formed a significant portion of the day's activities, delaying
almost all other business. When the Athletics Review
Committee (ARC) made its report, Board Chair Larry
Shane '56 blurted out deliriously, "We don't want to

has been caustic. Nearly thirty alumni have
created an organization entitled "Mind the

Board of Managers to "completely re-evaluate the decision." Following the admissions
office's announcement, the board resolved,
by majority vote and with several members
absent, to support the decision.
As a result, the board has been in a state
of tumult since Roger Thorturk '62, for

Boykin kicks off symposium
BY JARED LENOW

snowl@swarthmore.edu

The "seven deadly lies" of race and sexual orientation
were the hot topic of this year's Sager Symposium
keynote speech, given by Keith Boykin, author and former special assistant to former President Bill Clinton.
Boykin gave the speech as the kickoff event for this year's
symposium for lesbian, bisexual, gay and transgendered
studies Monday night in a crowded LPAC Cinema.
Boykin's speech, entitled "From Plantation to

"Swarthmore's right to read and retrieve any e-mail."
The EPC was recently formed to update college policy
on faculty and student privacy to include issues of electronic communication. But in light of the discrepancy, the
committee may also have to take staffpolicy into account.
Faculty and students are not yet subject to any restrictions on privacy except in matters subject to local, state or
federal law.
The difference in policy does not, however, stem from
an intentional decision to grant staff fewer rights in electronic privacy, according to Associate President for
Human Resources Melanie Young. Instead, the difference
is a reflection of different policies written at different

Rubin 'O3, however, told Regier that if
he were to resign, he would not be permitted constitutionally to serve in
these capacities.
"I put a lot of effort while I was on
Student Council," Regier said, citing
the Forum for Activism (FFA), which

was originally his idea and received
its charter three weeks ago. Regier
said his decision to step down was not
based on the fact that he had reached
one of his major goals.
"There are really some great people currently serving on council,"
Regier said. "I will miss working with
them."
"Being on council means volunteering a lot of time, and our council
members have been great about that,"
Co-PresidentLiane Rice 'O3 said. "But
if the rest of the semester was going to
be too busy, then Jeff made the right
decision."
"Jeff did put a lot of work into his
projects, and I regret losing a valuable
member of council," Rubin said. To

replace Regier, Rubin will assume
Regier's position as the council's representative on (SBC), while Rice will

take over as chair of CC. This

arrangement is the most practical,

because Rice and Rubin are both
familiar with the two committees.
Rice currently serves on the Charter
Committee, and Rubin is a former
SBC member.

"There's a precedent for the SC taking over the tasks of newly resigned
SC members," Rubin said. He pointed
out that when Liz Singreen 'O4
resigned as secretary earlier this
semester, Rice and Rubin filled in as
treasurer and secretary, respectively.

Professors look to create specific foreign study programs

Claims of variation in administrative support mark ambiguity of travel opportunities
BY NICOLE BRUNDA

nbrundal@swarthmore.edu

Although the college does not see itself moving
toward a full line of Swarthmore-run foreign study, some
faculty members have put countless hours of work into
the development of a handful of programs over the past
several years.
Whether these initiatives will materialize into official
Swarthmore programs remains to be seen.
"Until very recently, Swarthmore's strategy has been
to use other programs," Director of Foreign Study Steve
Piker said. He noted the exception of the Swarthmore program in Grenoble, France, which has been under the
jurisdiction of the French department for more than 30
years.

"There has never been any thought that Swarthmore
College would provide foreign study activities for its students" aside from Grenoble, Piker said. "But if it was going
to happen, it was understood that it would arise from the
important research connections of faculty."
The Poland/Ghana program, which has hosted students
for three years, will undergo reevaluation next May.
According to Piker, the program materialized when the
research interests of theater studies professor Allen
Kuharski, engineering professor Art McGarity and dance
program chair Sharon Friedler coalesced. The subsequent
formation of the Poland/Ghana initiativesreceived temporary support from the college, which will reevaluate them
at the end of next year.
McGarity said his interest in creating a program in
Poland emerged from a long-term professional interest in
the country and a desire to allow engineering students a
chance to study in a non-English speaking country. After
winning two Fulbright awards to teach at the Technical

University of Krakow, McGarity "made very close connections and ties with faculty in Poland."
McGarity said he benefited from a "parallel development" in the theater and dance departments, whose interests in Poland came out of a 1999 campus visit by the

Kuharski and Friedler also had professional interests
in Poland, and Friedler had already begun work on a
dance program in Ghana that would serve as a blueprint
for the Poland program. Through their combined interest, McGarity stirred up enough administrative support

After officials
from
Swarthmore,
Macalester,
Middlebury and Pomona met about developing a
program for environmental studies, Everbach began looking into a possible program. After receiving positive feedback about Ghana from contacts, he made connections
with academics there and began to arrange meetings in
both in Ghana and at Swarthmore.
Everbach said the fact that his program is even under
development depended largely on the "college's willingness to pay out money in the absence of any tangible
results." The college has already funded flights and $5OO in
immunizations for Everbach's trip to Ghana as well as
$12,000 for meetings in which Ghanaian administrators
met to formulate a program of studies.
Everbach feels that the success of his program depends
largely on individual initiative. "The college provides all
the reasonable resources an individual would need tg
move forward with a study abroad program," he said. "But
in the end, it's up to the individual to make it happen."
Not all faculty, however, are finding the administration

Students protest school they say teaches terror

F

phoen ix.swa rthmore.ed u

BY MATTHEW FITTING
mfittinl@swarthmore. edu
Recent government-sponsored TV advertisements say
those who buy illegal drugs are supporting terrorism. But
what if paying taxes were to produce the same result?
A group of about a dozen Swarthmore students believe
this is already the case. They say it takes form in the

Hemisphere Institute of Security Cooperation

•(WHISC), more commonly known as the School of the
Americas (SOA). Since 1946, the SOA has trained Latin and
South American military figures to allegedly lead democratic movements against non-democratic governments.
But those students claim this is far from what actually
happens. In fact, they said, the SOA teaches kidnapping
and torture, among other violent methods, as acceptable
means of bringing democracy to a country.
In November, those students joined others like them
from Bryn Mawr and Haverford and took part in an annual protest against the school, located in Fort Benning, Ga.
About 10,000 attended the protest, coming from colleges
and other locations across America.
On Sunday, a vigil for El Salvador Archbishop Oscar
who was murdered by a group of SOA graduates
for speaking against the supposedly democratic government in power at the time, took place on the steps of the
Philadelphia Art Museum. A famous Romero quote, "We
who have voices must speak for the voiceless," is the unofficial motto of the movement against the SOA.
The school boasts that it has graduated 6 of the 18 current presidents in Latin and South America, an example of
its success. The* students, however, have said that each
achieved his office through a military coup.
The Freedom of Information Act of 1966 released documents that revealed the school's true nature, including torture manuals used as handouts in classes. The school also
offers courses on counter insurgency, which label unions,
political parties, students, charitable organizations and
religions as possible rebellious elements. A bill to close the
school passed in the Senate in 2000, but it fell short in the
House of Representatives by just one vote.
Anna Staab 'O2, who has protested the SOA three of her
four years at Swarthmore, said the school represented
what was wrong with American foreign policy.
"I think it kind of started out as this Cold War mechanism," Staab said. "That was the ideological foundation
behind it." But the school ended up teaching and supporting too many questionable figures, who behaved in ques-

tionable ways, she said.
Staab also cited America's history of backing questionable allies to meet broader aims. "I think that's how the

ended with supporting the Taliban when they were
fighting the Soviets," she said. "But I think it's up to civilians to question our military tactics.
"I think it's a civilian's job to be able to monitor military action," she added. "I think we owe it to people who
fight, who don't have the freedom to question."
And the influence on Latin and South America has
been devastating. "They all have free elections," she conceded. "But the government is just so corrupt, there's so
much poverty."
Dylan Myles-Primakoff 'O5 also attended the protest,
driven by his opinion that the SOA represents the wrongs
of government. "I think it is a hypocritical thing for the
United States to be doing, in view of our stance on human
rights. And I think it's a secret thing, which I'm against in
government. I believe a government should be totally
transparent and not have things it hides from the public."
U.S.

While protesting, the number of elderly surprised him
most. "There were people on the march in wheelchairs and
people who brought little fold-out stools with them because
they couldn't stand the whole time," he said. "Just the
diversity of the group there, I think, is unusual. I mean,
you've got everybody there from anarchists to old nuns."
Sept. 11, Staab said, has made the base's closing seem
doubtful, at least for now. Congress is unlikely to take
action that might be seen as weakening defense. "The rhetoric is making it harder," she said. "In general, I think it's
a challenge to question foreign policy" these days.
But even if the base does close, Staab said, the movement against the SOA would continue, making sure another, similar base would not open somewhere else. "I think
the movement has broadened," she said. "The movement
doesn't just want to see the school close; it wants to see a
reexamination of U.S. foreign policy."

Objectors of World War II recall challenges

"One day I'll never forget was when I had
to pack up a dead person
because he had
died on my shift," Warren Sawyer said last
night. Sawyer, who served in the Civilian
Public Service (CPS) during World War 11,
was one of many conscientious objectors
present at the symposium "In Service to
Their Country: World War II Conscientious
Objectors in Civilian Public Service" held 4
p.m. yesterday at Memorial Hall in Bond.
Conscientious objectors during World
War II received no pay, often causing their
families financial hardship. Despite these

difficulties, some gave six or seven years of
service, even though only one year of service was required, according to Wendy
Chmielewski, the curator of the Peace

a variety of tasks as a part of the CPS. All of

in hospitals.
"CPS challenged the connection of masculinity and war," Tim Stewart-Winter 'Ol
said. Stewart-Winter wrote his senior honors history thesis on the CPS. Entitled
"Manning the Home Front: Gender,

Citizenship, and Conscientious Objection
During World War II," the thesis described
how many conscientious objectors were
criticized for being less masculine and weak
for refusing to take part in the violence of

the war. Stewart-Winter refuted this popular opinion by describing how these conscientious objectors, chopped down trees, dug
trails, worked in mental hospitals and par-

ticipated in medical experiments.
Margaret Hope Bacon, who wrote a
memoir about her experiences called "Love
is the Hardest Lesson: A Memoir," said that
although women were not drafted for military service, many objected to the war.
Bacon and other women nursed the ill in
hospitals and performed other services during the war. "The experience of the war
changed many of our lives," Bacon said.
Hospital work is what most associate

with those who worked as conscientious
objectors in World War 11. Sawyer recalls
the work he and fellow CPS members did to
improve the living conditions of the country's downtrodden and incompetent.
"Some patients never saw a doctor, and
some only saw doctors after a fight or an
accident," said Sawyer, who served at the
Pennsylvania State Hospital for the mentally ill. "There were few sheets for the beds in
the infirmary, and many patients slept on

rubber mats, sometimes in their own feces."
Before and during World War 11, the
mental hospital had a reputationfor terrible

conditions. The conscientious objectors
who worked their to fulfill their duty to the
United States were greatly affected by these
"subhuman living conditions" and initiated
a letter-writing campaign to have them conditions changed. Sawyer believes that he
and his fellow objectors "lessened the horror that these often forgotten members of
society faced each day."
As another conscientious objector fulfilling his duties at the Pennsylvania State
Hospital, Neil Hartman also volunteeredfor
medical research on jaundice. He became
infected with both Hepatitis A and B during
the study along with four of the other 49
men that participated. Hepatitis was an epidemic that took the lives of many men during the war and was of special interest to the
government. The service that Hartman provided to the United States provided medical
researchers with valuable information.
Following the symposium, some members of the audience and speakers then
shared comments and similar experiences
in a reception that followed the ceremony.
Currently, there is an exhibit on display in
the Peace Collection about the Civilian
Public Service.

ISP Yipes files for bankruptcy protection
BY CATHY DANH

cdanhl@swarthmore.edu

Yipes, Swarthmore internet service provider, filed a
voluntary petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 in
the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in San Francisco, last
Thursday.
Yipes' filing for bankruptcy is "potentially not good
news," said Mark Dumic, manager of networking and
telecommunications at Swarthmore. Yipes also provides

Internet services for Bryn Mawr and Haverford.
"I had a conversation with Yipes when the news broke,"
Dumic said. "Based on the conversation, our Internet connection is not in any immediate danger of being turned
off."
"Even though Yipes is facilities-based and had $291
million in equity funding, it has not been able to get
enough penetration in any given market to pay off its capital expenditures," Nick Maynard said. Maynard is a senior analyst at Yankee Group, an organization that analyzes research about the technology sector of the economy. He called the act a result of "the classic problem.
They couldn't get it to a point where they were cash-flow

positive."
Yipes, which offers service to 21 communities across
the United States, including Boston, Chicago, San
Francisco, New York and Washington, D.C., will attempt to
offer continuous service to its customers during the reorganization, company executives said.
According to Yipes, the move to file under Chapter 11
will assure its ability to continue business operations
uninterrupted during the reorganization. Yipes has made
arrangements for debtor-in-possession financing. This

option. According to Dumic, the move to a new Internet
provider is "a difficult process."
Dumic is also hesitant to switch service providers,
because there is no guarantee that another provider will
be able to maintain a company at a profit and provide
Swarthmore with a good deal for bandwidth.
"The telecommunications market is pretty murky in
terms of staying power financially," he said. "We negotiated a very good price with Yipes; other providers
charge more for the same bandwidth Yipes offered."
Despite fears that Yipes may go under, lawyers warn
that filing for bankruptcy does not mean a company will
shut down. "Chapter 11 is a process, not an ending,"
Kathryn Coleman said. Coleman is a bankruptcy lawyer
and the partner in charge of the San Francisco office of
Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP.
"It provides companies the breathing room they need to
restructure their finances and adapt their business plans
to changed market conditions," she said. "The goal, often
realized, is to promote the reemergence of stronger, healthier companies."
This reassurance is not enough to assuage Dumic's
fears. Even with the possibility of Yipes recovering, "we
are leaning towards leaving Yipes," he said. "It woufcl
behoove us to move to an Internet provider with long-term
stability."
Upon hearing news of Yipes' filing for Chapter 11, many

additional financing will allow Yipes to continue offering
service and support to its existing customers at all times.
Additionally, Yipes will be able to activate new customers
and otherwise conduct business as though the company
were not facing financial difficulty.
Filing for Chapter 11 will give Yipes "a couple of months
to reorganize without having to pay their bills, [which]
takes the heat off," Dumic said.

"It would behoove us to move
to an Internet provider with
long-term stability."
Mark Dumic
The move for filing will also prove beneficial to the tricolleges as they work with Yipes to come up with an
acceptable solution. "This move will buy Yipes and us time
to look at other options," Dumic said.
However, Swarthmore, along with Bryn Mawr and
Haverford, will use this time to search for another, more
reliable Internet service provider. Dumic has been in
touch with the other two colleges' Networking and
Telecommunications departments to start planning for a
backup in case "things deteriorate further at Yipes."
"Frankly, I think we are going to look at other viable
options for the college," Dumic said. "We will be monitoring the situation with Yipes closely."
The college will switch ISPs only if they become the last

Speaker describes 'seven deadly lies'

SC works to extend Sharpies hours

From SAGER, pg.

Boykin began his talk by discussing
how he first came out to those around
him as a Harvard law student. He was so
nervous about telling his mother he was
gay, he said, that he wrote out a script of
the conversation beforehand so he would
remember what to say.
'-v. "Armed with that script, I was finally
able to call my mom," he told the audience. "But I didn't want to read it,
because I was afraid it would sound too
scripted. But after I told her, she told me
she loved me." Later, Boykin said, his
mother advised him to be careful. Boykin
went on to joke about how he had come
out to his classmates and professors.
"I realized there was something very
difficult about this process of coming
out," he said. "It's a very difficult conversation to have. I didn't want to have the
experience, I just wanted to be out. So I
discovered the first rule of coming out: If
yyou tell the right people, you really don't
have to tell anyone else."
Boykin recalled how, shortly after he
had come out, one of his professors
approached him about the news. "At first I
was surprised that professors at Harvard
Law School would have nothing better to
talk about than their student's sexuality,"
he said. "But then I realized, if the professors spent as much time speculating about

their student's sexual orientation as we
spent guessing about theirs, it seemed to
be some sort of cosmic balance."
Boykin presented each of the "seven
deadly lies" as he made the speech: that
race is about status and sexual orientation is about behavior; that discrimination does not exist anymore; that homo-

sexuality is a "white thing"*; that blacks
are more homophobic than whites; that
there is no racism in the lesbian, gay,
bisexual, and transgendered community;
that the AIDS virus is no longer an issue;
and that homosexuality and spirituality

are inconsistent with each other.
Student reactions to the talk were

overwhelmingly positive.
"I thought Boykin was a wonderful
speaker and had a lot of good things to

say," Justin Belmont 'O5 said. "His discussion regarding religion brought up
some issues that were new to me. I had
never stopped to think about sexuality

and spirituality together."
The speech also touched some students on a very personal level.

"The thing that meant the most to me
was that it confirmed some things I felt
about myself and things I thought were
true but had never had directly
affirmed," Brandon Carver 'O4 said. "The
fact that you hear it from someone so
credible, so well respected, it lends it a
new legitimacy."

EPC shame
Last week, The Phoenix published a story about the
new Electronic Privacy Committee (EPC), which is
charged with formulating a coherent privacy policy covering electronic transmissions and communication
involving students, faculty and staff. We were happy to

see that the college community was taking steps to
ensure electronic privacy from inside and outside the college. We breathed a small, if incomplete, sigh ofrelief
when Judy Downing, director of Information Technology
Services, said, "We want to ensure the community that
personal communication is as private as can be."
Imagine our surprise to receive a letter from a staff
member (see letter to the editor on this page) about the
newly revised staff handbook that includes a passage that
does seem "diametrically opposed" to Downing's stated
goal. The passage reads, "Notwithstanding Swarthmore's
right to read and retrieve any e-mail... The use of passwords for computer systems does not guarantee that a
message is confidential or that the College will not
retrieve it."
Administrators claim that the discrepancy is merely a
product of miscommunication, and we don't doubt that it
is. Yet at no time during our reporter's interviews did
anyone say that the college should afford staff the same
electronic privacy as students and faculty. In fact, no one
even said that the college would take up the matter at all.
Employees of the college, whether faculty or staff,
deserve the same basic rights, be they freedom from hiring discrimination or adequate health insurance. We
believe that electronic privacy is one of these rights. If
network administrators are vowing to ensure as much
electronic privacy as possible for faculty, it's an outrage
for staff members to excluded from this privilege. Worse,
it seems that the new staff handbook is attempting to
intimidate employees with veiled threats of monitoring email messages and other communication once presumed
confidential.
We hope that the EPC will take this matter up with

administrators. To ignore the unfairly distinct policies
whether
presented in the staff and faculty handbooks
they are the product of discrimination or simply a misunderstanding
would constitute the official endorsement
of a policy prejudiced against an important sector of the
college community.

Reserved-senseless
"I found a key," touted a recent reserved-students email. The students groaned. Why, they asked, must their
inboxes be perennially littered with useless e-mails?
They needn't. In fact, many students send all reservedstudents e-mails directly into the trash or just delete
them immediately. It is not uncommon for a student to
receive five each day, sometimes from the same people.
Blocking them seems like a perfect solution, but, unfortunately, some reserved-students e-mails are important.
Information about the housing lottery, registration and
advising come through the e-mail system, and blocking
those e-mails means missing things you need to know.
You already know all this. There is a value to reservedstudents e-mails, but abuse of the reserved-students e-mail
privilege causes most students to tune them out all together. But what's to be done other than complain?
The sad truth is that there are many simple ways to
improve the system. Most of the reserved-students emails contain announcements about speakers coming to
campus. Students do want to know about events like
these, and e-mail is a good medium to publicize them to
the community. But the constant barrage keeps most
from paying attention to the announcement for a lecture
they might actually have been interested in.
Information about speakers could easily be consolidated into one weekly e-mail with all the vital information
in one place. That would give people advance notice to
plan for going to speakers, thereby improving attendance
while eliminating at least half of the e-mail clutter.
Other suggested solutions have included subscriber
lists or priority alert labeling for reserved-students emails, or limiting who has the privileges to send the mesand
sages. Whatever the case, the abuse has got to stop
it can't be that hard.

Electronic privacy should
extend to all of Swarthmore
Dear Editor:
I was stunned but not surprised to read, yet again, an
article relating the ever-widening gap between the treatment of the faculty and students and the treatment of
staff. The newly formed Electronic
Privacy Committee is meeting "a dollar short and a day late."
The distribution of the newly
revised staff handbook clearly states
the antithesis of the faculty handbook's policy regarding privacy. The
faculty handbook has a policy to protect and insure privacy as the article
are
states: "The paragraph also says that
messages sent to and from college community members cannot be intercepted or monitored." The newly revised staff handbook
states the complete opposite in section 15-7: "Such equipment and systems are owned by the College and all messages that are created, sent, or received using the systems remain the property of the College." It further stipulates, "Notwithstanding Swarthmore's right to read and
retrieve any e-mail... The use of passwords for computer
systems does not guarantee that a message is confidential or that the College will not retrieve it."
In asking Marty Cormican, who works in the human
resources department, for clarification as to why this policy was stated in the staff handbook, he emphasized that

e-mail and desks are the sole property of the college. Any
implied privacy, he said, is not real, and the college
reserves the right to have access. He further supported
college access to personal e-mail accounts under the
guise of protecting employees' rights to
work in an environment free of hostility and sexual harassment. He suggested
that this policy change was in response
to external corporate cases of harassing
only e-mails being retrieved to support
future legal action in cases of harassment. He also stated that access to email would be afforded to supervisors
and management when requested. I am

Tying college to community In search of values
BY KEITH REEVES
kreevesl@swarthmore.edu

Scores of colleges and universities across the country
are adapting to the expectation that they devote greater
attention to meeting the needs of the communities in
their backyards. As Maurice Eldridge '6l, Swarthmore's
vice-president for college and community relations, put
it: "There's a call across the nation for colleges and universities to get re-involved in what was often their original mission ae to provide service to the community
and where there are communities in dire straits, to help
them and to tie academic learning to problem solving."
Efforts at this integration are taking shape at
Cheyney and Drexel Universities, New School
University in New York, Trinity College and the
University of Pennsylvania.
Interestingly, the
approaches are as varied as the colleges and universities themselves: from investing resources in the construction of new schools and community centers to
"leveraging" intellectual capital in the service of area
businesses and community service projects.
Nevertheless, what is significant is that all the institutions are responding to the clarion call to marshal
their intellectual and economic resources, facilities, and
other assets for public problem-solving.
A sincere engagement with linking academic learning to societal problems has long been integral to
Swarthmore's identity. Students, faculty, staff, alumni
and members of our extended community habitually
"conjoin intellectual skills to place these skills in the
service of a better world." From active engagement in the
Upward Bound and Chester Community Improvement
Project programs to the Chester Boys Choir, the
Swarthmore community continues to be attentive to
social concerns whether in its backyard or beyond its
immediate geographical borders.
During the last two years, the Center for Social and
Policy Studies (CSPS) has formed a college- universitycommunity partnership committed to helping Chester
residents reverse more than two decades of academic,
economic, and social decline. This partnership was
launched in response to: (1) a desperate need for a more
targeted, coordinated, holistic approach to preparing
school children for work or post-secondary education
and (2) the recognition that fostering partnerships
among well-established communitybased organizations with proven track
records and harnessing their assets is
essential to confronting Chester's educational, economic, and social problems.
The cornerstone of this proposal,
"The Chatham Estates' Learning
Corridor," is based on the belief that by
creating an environment with the pro...

academic achievement of students and the professional
development of teachers and other school leaders, and 2)
those concerning the partnerships among organizations,
institutions, and public services that provide essential
supports for programs, school children and families. The
proposal offers a combined focus on academic and civic
enrichment, professional and curriculum development,
mentoring and youth development, and community support enrichment elements.
In his 1992 inaugural address, Al Bloom articulated a
set of cogent ideas about the direction of Swarthmore
College's educational mission as it enters the next century. Central to that mission, the president asserted, is
the role that the college will play in educating its student body in the service of a better world ae one that is
more equitable, inclusive, and humane. In fact, the
president helped spawn a series of community and
national discussions regarding the responsibility of the
nation's colleges and universities to link academic
learning to problem solving in our society. As part of
this continuing dialogue, CSPS's mission and plans as
they relate to the City ofChester constitute a set of innovative, if not ambitious, initiatives aimed at meeting
this challenge and placing Swarthmore at the forefront
of this national conversation.
At a time when society is placing greater demands
upon American higher education with regard to social
responsibility and leadership, we envision that the
Center's activities will inform this process. A central aim
of CSPS's activities will be to enhance Swarthmore's
capacity to effectively assist the Chester community "to
take charge of its own reconstruction and regeneration."
This sustained initiative in partnership with key stakeholders from the Chester community ae will build upon
and focus on providing opportunities for our students, in
particular, to gain an intricate understanding of the
problem this community faces, so as to "translate the
knowledge, insight, and power of their academic experiences into effective strategies for social change."
Over the next few months, we look forward to the college community's input as we seek to improve the conditions in communities such as Chester so that both children and families might prosper.

and Frodo Baggins

Every once in a while, we are faced withreal wrongs to be
righted, real challenges to us as a moral community. It is a
these times that we prove ourselves to be worthwhile indi
viduals, marching into the proverbial battle with courage
and determination, heads held high and hearts beating in
time to the proverbial drums. It is easy to be good when the
sun is shining, the gods are smiling and all's right with the
world. It is when the going is hard and the path is unclear
that we can truly reach toward our moral aspirations.
One such time came upon the world and a small individ
ual, much smaller than the rest of us, took on the burden o
carrying a ring to the very
depths of darkness and
despair, showing to us all
that it is not the size of the
person that counts, but the
size of his heart. The story of
which I speak is about friend-

ship and community, good

and evil, and some really
great scenery. It is of a
Hobbit called Frodo Baggins,
who has to carry the greatest
burden the world has ever
seen, the One Ring to Rule
Them All, forged by the Dark
Lord Sauron. Frodo and his
companions
must travel
through the harshest climes,

themselves toward the eventual destruction of the Ring
which is the last best hope for human- and elvenkind in this
time of darkness.
The story of Frodo, Gandalf, et al. and the Ring has the
capacity for giving all of us a moral education, teaching both
the virtues and the practical moral lessons of staying away

from the temptation of power, as all power corrupts. The
story may help us prevent the coming of another Stalin, and
it certainly does give us guidance in the present dark times of
the War against Terrorism, where the use of the most terrible
weapons must be restrained if evil is not to prevail.
Yet this story is not recognized for its moral example
beyond awards for makeup, cinematography, score and visual effects. Praise went instead to a movie that was honored for
an incorrect portrayal of a real person and his struggles with
a serious disease and his own genius. "A Beautiful Mind" is
indeed an effort at'portraying the life struggle of John Nash,
but it does so in a manner that cheapens the moral substance
of that struggle and thus prevents moral education.
Moreover, the romantic focus was misguided, as it puts window-dressing on what is, at its center, a very serious issue.
How typical; how Hollywood.
It comes to mind that the Academy Awards may not be the
best place to look for the education of virtue. With the glitz
and the glamour, the opulence and the self-importance, a
night at the Oscars, or watching the Oscars, may even stray
those who are searching away from leading the good life, in
the manner of Socrates. Materialism and cynicism have long
characterized Hollywood, along with extremely bad taste in
attire: Nicole Kidman's frumpish frock and Gwyneth
Paltrow's transparent garb are both cases in point.
And yet, society affords worth through occasions like the
Oscars, and thus it has few other opportunities to celebrate
moral worth in film. "The Fellowship of the Ring" stands out
in terms of its moral brilliance, and yet it was passed by in
favor oflesser plots, storylines and acting. How is the journey
of Frodo Baggins into the depths of evil in the name of Good
able to reach our youth if our society implicitly discounts it?
Shouldn't we all learn from what Frodo and his friends have
to offer? Shouldn't we elevate the story to the moral level it
deserves? I feel like that is a project worth undertaking
together.

Israel, Palestine and

our allies' priorities
Poor old Dick Cheney. All he wants to do is have a nice, simple invasion of Iraq. But before he can do that, he has to travel
all over the Mideast, trying to drum up support from our supposed allies. As a result, he has had to sit through a lot of nonsense about how Saddam's menace is overstated, how concerned
everyone is about the Palestinians, and that, if Israel would just
give up territory in exchange for more unenforceable promises
of peace, everything would be fine.

This is pure bunkum. Our
Mideast allies do not care about the
happiness of the Palestinians any
more than Cheney cares about the

happiness and well-being of his
lunch. Their primary concern is the

Nobody denies that the IsraeliPalestinian situation is awful. After
18 months of intifada and reprisals,
the death toll currently stands at

Palestinians. But, for comparison's
sake, let's take a look at some of the
other body counts, which don't get
mentioned as much. In 1988,

Saddam Hussein waged a war of
genocide against the Kurds in Iraq,
using chemical and possibly biological weapons to kill 200,000 civilians. The aftereffects are still
being felt in the form of birth defects and cancer rates. If the
United States and Britain were to lift their protection of the
Kurdish enclave, Saddam would probably go back to finish the
job. Despite the fact that he is one of the most proficient killers

P

of Muslims in the history of Islam, his neighbors won't cooperate in our attempts to put him down.
And let's not forget about Afghanistan, where the Taliban's

lunatic health care system killed thousands of women and children by denying them basic medical treatment and intentionally
starving war widows. In the field of civilian-killing, Mullah
Omar makes Ariel Sharon look like a rank amateur. But we
couldn't get any real support for the destruction of that worthless
regime. Call me cynical, but if Arab leaders are content to let this
sort of barbarism to go unchecked, I doubt that they're genuinely moved when they hear about violence in the West Bank.
They have also proven reluctant to take steps that might
peacefully improve the lot of Palestinians. Take the case of Saudi
Arabia, for example. Despite the fact that it needs millions of
low-wage guest workers to keep its economy running, Saudi
Arabia places strict controls on the number of Palestinians who
are able to live and work in the country. "We don't want too
many Palestinians here," one Saudi prince said to The New
Republic's Martin Peretz. "They are troublemakers. We accept
only those who have married Saudi men and, of course, those we
need
mostly teachers and doctors." It's a neat little trick. They
shed crocodile tears over the economic distress of the
Palestinians, while enforcing restrictive work and immigration
policies which worsen that poverty. Young men who are unable
to get jobs have to find some way to occupy their time, and that's
where Hamas and the al-Aqsa Martyr's Brigade come in. Although
gainful employment of Palestinians might be blocked, there's
always plenty of foreign aid available for weapons purchases.
After all, what would the generals, princes and presidents-forlife of the Mideast do without the Israeli-Palestinian problem?
They'd really be in trouble if their most common solution to the
conflict pushing all the Israelis into the sea happened. If the
blood-sucking Zionist bogeyman ever left the picture, the leaders
of the Arab world would have to cook up some other plausible
distraction from the poverty and repression that exist inside
their borders. The Palestinians might start taking more notice of
the fact that Yasser Arafat, winner of the 1994 Nobel Peace Prize,
allows no freedom of the press or peaceful political opposition in
his brutish little fiefdom. Without a struggle against Israel, the
Arab dictators are like Joe McCarthy without the Red Scare.
I won't pretend that I know how to make the bloodshed in
Israel stop any more than I know how to make cats and dogs live
together peaceably. But I do know that we shouldn't be accepting
lessons on peacemaking from leaders who have every incentive
to make the violence go on forever, or taking their claims at face
value when they say that the suffering of the Palestinians is causing them great mental anguish. If these men were really interested in making the Mideast a more peaceful and prosperous
region, they would have relinquished power a long time ago.

Linking meat consumption, grain
distribution and world hunger
BY JULIE CORDER
jcorderl@swarthmore.edu
On behalf of the Animal Rights Coalition (ARC), I
would like to thank everyone who helped to make this
year's celebration of the Great American Meatout such
a great success. The dining staff did a wonderful job of
providing vegan dinners and desserts as well as some
great decorations. WHYY 90.9 FM, the Philadelphia public radio station, did a segment on Morning Edition
about our Veg Night along with a few other meatout
events in the area. Fifty-three people signed our pledge
to forego meat in honor of the event (not including those
of you who forego meat every day), and, on Wednesday,
night, we collected 147 signatures supporting our efforts
to shut down Huntingdon Life Sciences, a large animal
testing company headquartered in England. We also
enjoyed the opportunity to speak to many members of
the campus community about animal welfare issues.
I want to state explicitly that all of us in ARC completely respect the right of other students and student
groups to express their points of view. At the same time,
I feel it is important to disabuse a few misconceptions
promulgated in the flyers that were distributed in
Sharpies during Veg Night.
Unfortunately, I did not get a chance to speak with
the authors of the flyer, which questioned whether a
plant-based diet actually helps to reduce world hunger.
One of their facts I completely agree with: The production of meat is not the most efficient use of grains.
Depending on the sources sited, it takes between 4.5 and
16 pounds of grain to produce a single pound ofbeef (the
low figure, 4.5, is asserted by the National Cattlemen's
Beef Association, while a study by the USDA Economic
Research Service and Agricultural Research Service
found it actually takes 16 pounds). In a time when there
are L2 billion underfed and malnourished people in the
world, it seems a no-brainer to directly distribute the
grain already being produced to people rather than
feeding

it to livestock.

The flyer distributed at Veg Night mainly questioned the economic feasibility of actually distributing
the grain that would be available if people ate less beef.
This would be a reasonable concern if all of the grain in
the world was being grown in the United States, fed to
cattle in the United States, and then distributed as beef
to people in the United States

March 28, 2002

This, of course, is not the way that agriculture
works. Rather, many nations are now seeing the effect
of using their own land to graze cattle, and, in addition,
much of the grain that is grown in those countries is
now being used to feed cattle. The meat that is then
produced is either exported or sold locally to those that
can afford it.
An unfortunate side effect of this process is that
many countries that were once able to grow enough
grain to be self-supporting now have to import grain in
order to support their livestock and their citizens. For
example, Egypt was able to produce all of its own grain
20 years ago; livestock consumed only 10 percent of the
grain grown there. Now, livestock consume 36 percent
of their grain, and Egypt must import 8 million tons of
grain each year.
Similarly, China went from feeding 8 percent of its
grain to livestock in 1978 to feeding 26 percent of its
grain to livestock in 1997. In that same time, they have
gone from being a net exporter of grain to being the second largest grain importer in the world.
Costa Rican beef production quadrupled between
1960 and 1980, causing much of its rainforests to be
destroyed to make room for cattle grazing. Sadly, most
of their beef is exported to the United States, leaving the
Costa Rican people with less and less to eat. In fact, over
half of the beef produced in Latin America is exported
to countries like the United States.
It is also worth remembering that there are many
people going hungry right here in the United States; we
need not ship grain around the world to find people who
would be grateful for it. At present, the United States is
the world's largest exporter of grain, and much of that
exported grain helps sustain livestock production in
other parts of the world. We could help the hungry right
here in the United States if we weren't exporting so
much of our grain to other countries so that they could
in turn raise livestock to sell back to us.
There's no question that hunger can be a complex
issue, one without simple answers or quick remedies.
Still, one thing that we can all do is adopt a diet that
puts less strain on the earth, saves resources and

allows more of the world's citizens to enjoy good, nourishing food.
I'd like to invite anyone interested in discussing this
and other animal rights-related issues to attend ARC's
next meeting on Tuesday night at 9 p.m. in Trotter 303.

directed by Tiffany Lennon 'O2, this weekend. The

and costumes, and, of course, pineapples.
"Cabaret," a John Kander and Fred Ebb musical, is
set in 1929 Germany before the Nazi rise to power. As
the play opens we see Clifford Bradshaw (Jacob Ross
'O5) on the train as he makes his way to Berlin. He
meets Ernst Ludwig (Allen Frost 'O4) who helps him to
find a place to live with the elderly Fraulein
Schneider (Tanya Hahnel 'O5).
Once settled, Cliff visits the sleazy Kit Kat Club,
where he meets the enchanting English singer Sally
Bowles (Blair Cochran 'O3). Sally, with no place to
stay, soon shows up at Cliffs door. He is unable to turn
her away, and they begin living together, soon falling
in love. Meanwhile, Fraulein Schneider gets engaged
to a Jewish greengrocer, Herr Schultz (Brett Klukan
'O3), a difficult decision due to the increasing influence
of the Nazis in Germany. Sally and Cliff begin fighting
as the world around them starts to dissolve.
The deliriously creepy Emcee (Marty Griffith 'O5)
narrates the play. He has at his beck and call the

"I liked the chaos of the show," Lennon said. "It's
an interesting time period. It shows the progression
and reflects the way things actually happened." The
mixing of the historical content and the surreal are
apparent in the design of the play: An exposed wooden structure covered with light bulbs brings the audience into the real world of the cabaret of Berlin, while
the lights and sounds heighten the emotional intensity of the piece beyond its literal setting. The play's
strong sexual themes also work to contrast and
emphasize the historical background of the story.
The highly charged content of the play was never a
problem for the cast. Making a transition from
the almost Bacchic abandon in the world of cabaret to
the grave reality of the Nazi occupation, "the cast
never blinked," Lennon said. "They were really
unflappable with all the zany things that I asked of

them."

This production works to highlight the lives of its
female characters. "It's a play about the three principle women [Sally, Fraulein Schneider and Frau Kost]
and the similaritiesbetween their lives," Lennon said.
"Cliff is our eyes and ears, but the women show what
you had to sacrifice to get through this tumultuous

Style and spring: the rites of mating
Spring is upon us, dahling!
Child of nature that you are, you have, perhaps, noticed
that the birds and the bees have begun to pair off. And your

you to ponder your chances of doing the same.
Now, doll, the outlook for you is bleak until you learn a

poor style. But what to do when a crush's unfortunate
taste starts to influence your fashion? That brings us to
this week's question.
Dear Style Queen,

As a member of Swarthmore's beautiful and fashion-conscious minority, I have always felt called to
assume a leadership position in our community. My
boyfriend recently gave me a pair of wide-leg raver
pants. They definitely flatter my long legs and compact
buttocks, but everyone knows that the rave look is
out. I pride myself on being stylish without ever being
a mere follower, so I naturally resisted the rave look
when it was everywhere. Can I start wearing wide-leg
pants now without being hopelessly behind the times?
—Never Been a Raver Boy 'O2
Dear Never Been,
Your concern is well-directed, doll. Raving was long
ago dealt the death knell of wide-scale popularity. At one
point it seemed like every bland all-American boy
around had traded in his white hat for a glow stick.
Now, whether rave culture will, like break-dancing
regain its edge by returning to its underground roots
or, like disco, be periodically revived by nostalgic
designers, remains to be seen. One thing is clear: It is
too early to wear raver pants ironically.
Dahling, I do not doubt your leadership skills, and I
generally encourage informed innovation. But can you
single-handedly pull a trend out of the depths of out

about fashion, of course.
Just as the peacock cannot get a piece without

ting enough, doll? Take a
look at your outfit. Yes, a
maroon T-shirt proclaiming

Style Queen

"Guilt Without

Sex" is a
self-fulfilling prophecy.
Beautiful clothing leads to beautiful relationships. Once,
dahling, long before matriculating at this style-forsaken
school, I loved a (straight!) gentleman with a flair for fashion. Oh, how he had an eye for vintage! How he ruthlessly
ridiculed the style-impaired! How he strutted in well-shined
black shoes! At times I dare say the bold boy showed me up.
In an ideal world, doll, this is how love is: inspired by
skilled fashion decisions.
But the sweatshirts-and-flannel-pants community we
live in is anything but ideal, and waiting around for a lover
with fashion sense here equates to a vow of celibacy. So while you should never relax the
style standards to which you hold yourself, you may have to compromise them when it

'Genius' book should be made into movie

Hoping to pry me from my studies and force me to read
something from which I might actually derive some of that
long-lost friend, pleasure, my friend gave a book. The title
and the cover made it look dreadfully boring. "A
Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius." Hmm. Drapes
and sunsets and all sorts of refined things all over the elaborate cover.
Hmm. I eyed it warily and
set it aside. She'd talked it up
so much. I would read it,
because I did respect her recommendation. But alkene
substitution definitely came
first. Then break arrived, and
I was absolutely elated to
finally have free time, plus I'd

decided to spend the night
awake so I wouldn't sleep
through my 4 a.m. ride to the
airport. Hyped up on NoDoz
and not even wanting to look
at any of my academic work
(it was break, after all), I

cracked David Eggers' (whoever he was) masterpiece.
I could not stop laughing,
eriously. I thought at first it was my total hyperstimulated delirium, but the caffeine wore off, and the thing was

still absolutely riotous. The man, with his witty writing
style and offhand, random quips, is not just funny. He's a
mastermind satirical genius.
As I made my way through

"A

Heartbreaking

Work of

Staggering Genius," I invented the scenarios in my mind's
eye, imagining what the events Eggers' described must
have looked like. Him as a senior in college, holding his
cancer-ridden mother's nose that would just not stop bleeding with a stained rag while they watched talk shows on
the sofa bed together. Splitting hairs with his older sister

over his parents' estate, once they've both died of cancer
within five weeks of each other. Arguing over, of all things,
his father's billfold. Him as the legal guardian of his eightyear-old brother, moving to Berkeley, to be gawked at and
interrogated by middle-aged moms at school functions,
and the grandiose lies he started telling them when he
finally got sick of hearing the same question. From front
cover to back, the book had me busting a gut. The only
thing better would be to actually see the things happening.
So here's my plan:
Case point #1: All the so-called comedy flicks I've been
to lately have consisted either of a) overdone toilet humor,
b) overdone sexually-connoted humor or c) some combination of the two. Punch lines are threadbare, tiresome;
Hollywood humor is essentially in a rut.
Proposed Solution #1:
David Eggers' written humor, his detailed accounts of
daily events, mundane though they may seem, are brilliant, original and, refreshingly, truly funny. Make his
book a movie. Get audiences laughing at the originality of
his humor, which surrounds his unique, and very funny
life circumstances.
Case point #2:
Lots of movies have recently come out in theaters that
are "based on" books but only loosely represent the material presented therein ("A Beautiful Mind" and its deviations were the subject of much pre-Oscar debate; see recent
Times archives if interested). That means a lot of restruc-

turing had to take place in order to create the actual

March 28, 2002

screenplay.
Proposed Solution #2:
Eggers' book, in its
current form,
would
make a lovely screenplay.
Just cut and paste that
baby into scripts, grab
some actors and a reasonable set, and you're good
to go. The actors don't
even have to be that
great, so long as they follow verbatim Eggers' fabulous dialogue. Throughout "A Heartbreaking
Work
of
Staggering

Courtesy www.ptanderson.com

Genius," Eggers details
the occurrence of events and dialogue that took place during those events and offers his own perspective. It's fluid,
it's funny, and I want to see it enacted. This book needs to
be made into a movie.
Until I rule the world or weasel my way into the life of
some Hollywood bigwig (don't hold your breath), my master plan is not likely to happen, at least not any time soon.
While I perfect my plot to take over the world and get
Eggers' book on the big screen, take a springtime stroll to
Borders and do yourself a $14.95 favor. If you've got the
slightest inkling of a sense of humor, you're bound to have
a good laugh. The book is well-written and hilariously
anecdotal/philosophical/satirical. It came out just after
Eggers' college graduation, as he was scrambling for
employment
which hits close to home. And you can
rationalize the divergence from your more "academic"
duties by telling yourself that you were READING and he
does use big words.

First impressions are important
Jonah sits down with admissions' Arlene Mooshian, the first person all Swatties meet
Arlene Mooshian is the first person a lot of us saw when we came, young and brighteyed high schoolers, to the Swarthmore admissions office. She's been an admissions
office receptionist here since before I was born, and she will probably continue to be so
for some time after we've all gone our separate ways. In short, she's a Swarthmore fixture, and, as such, a pretty interesting person to talk to. I got in touch with her early on
a Monday morning, before the spring-breaking waves of prospective students coming in
this week fully hit. We chatted a bit about admissions, mistakes thereof, jokes, and the
stress of doing what she does. This interview doesn't really do justice to what an interesting, nice person she is. I encourage all of you to go hang out with her for yourself
when she's not too busy dealing with the specs and their families, of course.

Jonah Gold: How are you doing?
Arlene Mooshian: I'm doing very well, thank you.

and, during the interview season, we also have senior fellows who interview. There's a lot of interviews that are
scheduled each year. We also arrange overnight visits for
prospective students who want to stay in the dorm
overnight, and that's one of my responsibilities.
JG: How long have you been here?
AM: Over 21 years.

JONAH GOLD

Where Eagles Dare

JG: Is there anything you really don't like? Anything you would change?
AM: Well, there's something that I wish I could change, but I can't change, and that is the
pressure and the stress when you're dealing with people in front of you wanting to talk to
and the phone is ringing and you have to get the interviews out and you have to get a tour
started. When all of that comes at the same time, it can produce anxiety. But you can't
change

JG: Could you tell me a little bit about what you do in
the admissions office?
AM: OK. As admissions office receptionist, I meet and
greet a lot of visitors each day and help them. Give them
directions if they need directions, tell them when the
tours are, when the group sessions meet, answer the telephone, make appointments for the ten deans in the office,

:

JG: Do you enjoy dealing with all of that?
AM: I enjoy doing it. It's the best job on campus, as far as I'm concerned. It's fun to meet
the people, and it's satisfying to be able to help them. To answer their questions, to give
them travel directions to their next stop. Just being helpful and courteous and respectful
of who they are.

that.

JG: Do you have a secret to dealing with that kind of pressure?
AM: I don't. I don't have a secret. The person who sits at that desk, first of all, has to have
a calm demeanor to begin with. I think someone who's high-anxiety to begin with would
have a more difficult time dealing with the pressure, because it can be pretty intense at

times.
JG: What do you do to relax from that, in your spare time?
AM: My husband and I travel. And I sing in a church choir.
JG: To your knowledge, are there actually any "admissions mistakes"?
AM: You mean as far as who we've accepted?
JG:

Yeah.

AM: I don't know of any. Although I did hear, once, of an international student who was
accepted as a freshman and should not have been because he had been in college. But, I
mean, that's minor. If there are mistakes, I haven't heard of any. I think they do a pretty
good job with their decisions.
,

JG: Wow. Has the admissions processed changed over

these years?
AM: The process hasn't changed, but the volume definitely has. Not only numbers of visitors increased, numbers of
deans has increased, and they just added the fellows about three years ago so that they're
able to accommodate a lot more interviews.
m ll^^^^^^^m^^m
"

JG: This isn't quite your field, but what do they have to do to make a good impression on admissions?
AM: That's mostly for the interviewers, because I don't have any really direct influence
on a person's application or anything like that. Certainly if a person comes in wearing
shorts and sandals, that's not appropriate if they're coming for an interview, because first

JG: That's a relief. What are your favorite foods?
AM: Oh, my goodness. Jonah, I don't know. I don't have an answer for that. I don't answer
the silly questions. What is my favorite tree? No.
JG: Do you know any good jokes?
AM: I probably knew some, but I forget them as fast as I hear them. So I can't think of any.
JG: Finally, is there anything you want the college to know about yourself or the
admissions office?
AM: You want personal information? Like I'm married, I have three children, I have eight

grandchildren.

impressions are important.

JG: How many people do you interact with as receptionist on any given day?
AM: Depending on the time of year
This week is going to be a very busy week. A lot of
schools are closed between Palm Sunday and Easter. We've already started, as you can see
[motioning to a spec filling out a form nearby]. There could be as many as fifty to a hundred students coming each day this week. We'll also have busloads of students coming.
Next week we have seven busloads throughout the week. So, right there, you have thirtyfive to forty-five students on one bus coming from one school, so that will greatly increase
the number of visitors. It's thousands of students every year that come through that
office. With their parents, and brothers and sisters.

JG: If you want them to know that.
AM: It doesn't matter to me.

...

JG: I guess just about the admissions office.
AM: Just that we do have a lot of students working in the admissions office. As clerical
help, as tour guides, as overnight hosts. And it's a great place to be connected with. I think
the students who are involved with the admissions office sense that it's all great people
who work there. We just love being here at Swarthmore.

Letting both sexes in, keeping sex out
From skittishness to Screw: the evolution of dating rules and practices
BY ELIZABETH WRIGHT

ewrightl@swarthmore.edu

"That the sexes should be educated together in
our higher institutions of learning seems to partake so much of the nature of an axiom as to be
almost incapable of proof."
So spoke former college president Edward H.
Magill in an 1873 address arguing a radical position. He was in favor of coeducation.
Magill frequently enumerated the educational
and moral benefits of having students of both
sexes living in the same buildings, attending
classes together and eating in the same dining
room. But he also made sure to assuage the concerns of those who feared that other, more
inescapable axioms were at play when men and
women came together at college .
Through a slew of stringent restrictions, often
riddled with double standards placing the burden
of chastity on women, the college embraced the
challenge of letting both sexes in but keeping sex
out.

Rules were very strict and specific. The 1912
guide to student life stated that "the young women
may walk with the young men in the rectangle
that extends east as far as the Dean's porch, west
as far as the west porch and south as far as the
front group of steps on the asphaltum." Walks in
the Crum Woods were not permitted for groups of
three or fewer. Skating or sledding at night was
"absolutely forbidden either with college or outside men." A regulation of uncertain meaning
stated, "College bedding may not be taken upon
the roof for any purpose."
The college kept students on a tight leash and
under close watch. Magill explained that students
could be "together freely in the halls and parlors
and upon certain portions of the grounds between

recitation hours and on holidays
of course
under the care and conscientious oversight of a
large body ofresident instructors and professors."
No visiting at all was allowed after 9 p.m. for
any student in 1883. By 1948, the curfew for first
semester women was 10:15 p.m., extended to 12:30
THE PHOENIX

a.m. on weekends. A Phoenix article detailing the
policies claims that "upperclassmen will notice a
liberal trend here." The college was more lenient
with senior women and those with high grade
averages.
The Woman's Student Governance Association was the enforcer ofcurfews and purveyor of
numerous, pesky pink, blue, white and yellow
forms women had to file before catching a Chesterbound bus for a Saturday night movie. The WSGA
also monitored the sign-out book in which women
had to record their evening goings-out and comings-in in such detail that the book made fascinating and gossip-producing reading for those taking
a break from more academic texts.
The hours when men could visit the parlor of

"College bedding may not be

Guide to Student Life, 1912
the women's dorm was a recurrent issue in the
era before coed housing. Religion professor J.
William Frost, who has collected an impressive
selection of Swarthmore sex anecdotes through
his research on the changing sexual moralities of
liberal Quakers, recounts one of the visiting
hours debates in a Friends Historical Library
article, "Three Twentieth Century Revolutions."
"When students asked to extend the time for
fifteen minutes, the Dean of Women refused. A
coed complained, 'What can we do in an extra fifteen minutes that we cannot do before?' The
Dean's response: 'I don't know what you [could]
do before but you could do it twice with an extra
fifteen minutes.'
There was a constant tension between increasing college regulations and increasing student
creativity. Women were supposed to crack their
doors open the width of a book while men were

visiting to facilitate the work of hall proctors
a
policy neatly subverted with matchbooks.
In January 1948, after reading a copy of the
recently published Kinsey Report, Alfred
Kinsey's first major investigation of sexual
habits, The Phoenix published an editorial noting
that the report "shows that the amount of sexual
activity on the part of the college male is far in
excess of that recognized by the institution of the
college." The editorialfurther noted the "total sexual outlet" of a single, college-aged male was
"approximately two orgasms per week." The editors asked college administrators to read the
report and take it into account. The college president was so displeased that he prohibited distribution of the next issue of The Phoenix.
Despite the lack of empirical evidence about
racy romance, Frost said, "My guess is that there
were a lot of things going on." He has heard
rumors of a GI returning to college after World
War II whose intent was to deflower every virgin

on campus. Yet Frost noted that alumni are unreliable sources of information about sexual
exploits now shrouded in the mists of history.
"Students then, as now, tend to exaggerate," he
said.
In the memories of many former students and
faculty members, the 1966-67 school year was a
turning point in changing attitudes toward sexual behavior. Before that, it was an unwritten rule
that students who were caught in the act wouldbe
quietly expelled. Also up until that year, Frost
said, the same penalty applied to men in homosexual relations.
In the fall of 1966, the deans felt the need to
spell out a policy that explicitly outlawed sex
among students, on- and off-campus. Heavy
debate about the role of a college as an enforcer of
morals ensued, centering on whether the college
should act in loco parentis.
By the end of the 19605, however, the college
had relaxed many of its positions, realizing they
were unenforceable. Campus speakers in the

and Deirdre Conner

A rowdy romp around Swarthmore's campus in search of the ultimate site
10. McCabe study rooms

Making it here is one of the college's traditional graduation requirements. The academic decor reminds us that
even studying can be frisky. This old standby is perfect
for relieving finals week stress but don't wait for
stress levels to erupt... and, hey, keep it down! People
are trying to study here!
PROS: everybody's doing it; it makes staying 'til closing
worthwhile; you can shed that library-dork reputation;
furniture allows for creativity
CONS: everybody's doing it; the doors don't lock; quiet
surroundings make for muffled moans; from then on,
you'll always wonder about those stuck-together pages
THINGS TO WATCH OUT FOR: keep books out of it
replacement fees are costly; there are stodgy librarians;
fellow intruders might be looking for a "study break"
(damn those doors!)

Make beautiful music together! In these somewhat
soundproof artistic getaways, you can crescendo and climax in perfect harmony. In pursuit of the ultimate carnal
symphony, remember the rhythm method can lead to
unexpected creations. Invite your partner here for a
musical romp, and you'll never strike a sour note.
PROS: carpeting; lots of natural light; doors that lock;
automatic (if not always on tempo) mood music
CONS: pianos collect fingerprints like my grandmother
collects cats; in a practice-makes-perfect world, music
majors may come to investigate less-than-perfect pitch
THINGS TO WATCH OUT FOR: move closer to the door
and people can't see you through the window; there's a
chance of rug burn; watch out for pianos on wheels
DIFFICULTY RATING: 2

is surpassed only by the infinite possibilities of a

PROS: flat surface; isolated; romantic setting; good for
the claustrophobia-inclined
CONS: can be chilly; beware of ants and chiggers;
there's nowhere to hide; a dilemma stone on the bone
or grass in the ass
WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR: the long walk back on
unsteady legs; those Public Safety officers again; possibility of poison ivy in compromising places; clean up

You promised the world, and now you can deliver the
stars. Take your lovemakingto astronomical heights and
feel like you're the only two (or three!) people in the universe, knowing all the while that miserable CS majors
are slaving away beneath you in the Sun lab.
PROS: fogging the lens of the telescope; finally getting to
mean it when you say, "oh, the equipment is enormous!"

The ultimate in romance; a rose by any other name
would still be an aphrodisiac. Although by day it's closely
patrolled by arboretum vigilantes, by night this sweet,
semi-private floral enclave provides the perfect place to
declare your undying love (hell, all of us can love a
nameless stranger for a few hours).
PROS: the sweet floral bouquet can mask any post-party
unpleasantness; circular shape and romantic setting
provide at least the illusion of privacy; nearby streetlamps create instant moonlight; it's close to the shuttle
(for when the clock strikes midnight)
CONS: thorns horrible, flesh-gouging thorns

Swarthmore's own Asian grotto of love is perfect when
you're feeling like a wild thing. Surrounded by nature's
own mighty shafts, the beast in each of us can roam
free at last (at least until you roll out onto Sharpies lawn
in a fit of passion). Good for those wanting to experiment with exhibitionism without full exposure.
PROS: like the tiger, you too will be concealed by the
thick, turgid rods as you prowl the bush; you can explore
the exotic, then finish up with Sundae Bar
CONS: its small space means few horizontal options;
only the very flexible will reap the full benefits; bamboo
stumps inside grove may cause chafing
WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR: nosy Public Safety officers
with flashlights; damn those Sharpies picnickers; when
one stalk shakes, it rocks the whole grove

PROS: fantastic views of campus; bragging rights;

ultimate in secret campus hideaways for the past 20
years. Filled with windows and scrawlings from

1 Worth Health Center

When your sickly pallor is crying out for a certain rosy
glow, what better place to turn than the beds at the
health center? Replete with thermostats, beds, chairs,
tables and, in some cases, baths, these private rooms
provide all the comforts of a low-budget hotel room
right on campus. The sterile atmosphere lends itself to
impromptu games of doctor, and a post-coital snack is
merely a buzzer away.
PROS: there are beds with sterilized linens (no sharing
the past love) and private bathrooms for thorough cleanup; looking flushed convinces the nurses you're feverish;
if you throw your back out attempting the "inverted halfmoon weasel-basket," you're in the right place
CONS: like your mom, Worth nurses like to check in on
you when you're "sick"; doors don't lock (but the bathroom ones do); beds can be noisy
WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR: finals-week rush when the
health center turns into an epidemic zone, the nurse
making random thermometer rounds; the possibility of
actually getting sick while there

Worth promotes sexual health
BY LILLIE DREMEAUX

ldremeal@swarthmore.edu

With an estimated two-thirds
of the student body engaged in
sex and most of them relatively
well educated about its risks,
there is pressure on Worth
Health Center to provide sexrelated services and products
for all students confidentially

and cheaply.
Director of Worth Health
Center Linda Echols estimated
that a third of the student body
had never had sex, a third had
had sex with three or fewer
partners, and a third had had
sex with more than three. "A lot
of students are having intercourse in their first year," she
said, pointing out that the definition of "intercourse" varies
among individuals. She also
estimated that between five and
10 percent of students were virgins at graduation.
As for Worth's reputation for
its profusion of sex-related services
sometimes to the chagrin
of students who are just plain

sick —Echols said such claims
were not legitimate. "We're not

all about sex," she said. "We're
just comfortable with sex."
The doctors who work in
Worth are more comfortable

than most asking questions
about symptoms that patients
might not link to sexual practices on their,own. "When you

see folks with a sore throat
that's not strep, you have to ask
about other causes," she said.
Regarding unsolicited offers for

pregnancy tests, she said, "family planning clinics do pregnancy
tests every time you come in,
regardless of whether you've

had sex or not, so we're not out
of the norm."

Worth has offered basic gyne-

cological services since shortly
before 1980. Around that time,
companies that manufactured
birth control pills began discount
programs for non-profit distribution centers whose main buyers
met certain income criteria. By
emphasizing that college students usually buy the pill independently, Echols said, Worth
could portray the student body as
"indigent," ensuring the discount. Worth also "argued to the
companies that these are future
long-term users," she said.
"The fact that they sell pills

for $6 is amazing compared with
the $35 a month you would pay
in the real world," sexual health
counselor Kate Hurster 'O3 said.
Worth also offers diaphragms
and cervical caps at discounted
prices. "If you start taking a new
pill, Worth will find a way to get
it for you and only charge you $6
a month," Hurster added.
Echols said the price for birth
control pills would increase to $7
a month soon. However, "we
give out a free pack of pills here
a little more than
and there
here and there." Students with
dire financial need, she said,
"need that kind of support."
The health center first began
to "widely dispense" condoms
with the onslaught of HIV and
AIDS in the early
1980s,
although they had been available beforehand. Then-president of the college David Frazier
was a physician and had
worked in epidemiology, Echols
said, and he worked with Worth
to prevent the spread of the
virus. At that time, Worth also
involved itself more actively

with bringing

speakers

to

increase AIDS awareness.
"We used to take kids into

Philly

for HIV counseling,"
Echols said, but Worth hired its
own HIV counselor in 1987.
"Having an HIV counselor was
really forward for small colleges" at that time, she added.
At a highly discounted price,
Worth began dispensing the
products for safer sex classes,
and to those who wanted to distribute them at parties, a practice that Worth has continued. "I
went in and asked for 120 condoms" for distribution at a
Coming Out Week event, SQU
board member Jon Elmer 'O4
said, "and they gave them to me
at 10 cents each."
generally
Worth
respond to student

does
needs.

Hurster said the sexual health
counselors, who often act as a
link between the student body

and the health center, have "a
very positive relationship" with
Worth. The health center "provides exceptional and confidential services," she said.
"A lot of it is student input,"
Echols said, but "you learn to
understand the needs. Some
folks have no trouble telling you
when you're being naive." Her
understanding of same-sex sexu-

al health needs in particular, she
said, grew out of her experience
as a nurse at the University of
Pennsylvania, where she developed a rapport with many lesbian students.
There have, however, been
occasions when it has been
impossible to meet specific
demands. Several years ago, a
group of students began pushing
for Worth to stock cervical caps.
"They were lobbying. They really wanted it for a long time,"
Echols said. Providing the cap
immediately was impossible,
because Echols had to undergo
training first. After she did,
Worth began discounting it.
Worth recently acquired the
means to test men for STDs
through a urine test rather than
an invasive procedure. Echols
said she had learned from the
SHCs that men were avoiding
the tests because doctors told
them they were not necessary
unless there were certain symptoms. Echols disagreed, and
Worth began to provide the
urine tests. The number of male

students coming in for STD tests
has spiked to two or three a
week as a result.
"It's about understanding
what's at the cutting edge and
pushing to take advantage of it
at the right time," she said. "It's
amazing. It's really made a dif-

ference in the number of guys
who come in." Fifteen men have
come in for tests for chlamydia
or gonorrhea since the start of
the semester, compared with 20
all of last year.
Female
students

seek

Worth's STD tests much more
frequently than males. A total of
71 females received tests last
year. The number of students
actually afflicted with STDs,
however, is lower than in the
general population, according to
the American Social Health
Association (ASHA). One in ten
Americans has chlamydia, one
in five has herpes, according to
statistics on the ASHA Web site.
According to Worth's records,
molluscum
chlamydia and
infect zero to three Swarthmore
students per year each, herpes
infects between two and three
and genital warts infect two to
four. In comparison to other colleges, Echols said, Swarthmore
is "ahead of the pack, especially
for small colleges."

Action then and now, sans studying
From SEXUAL HISTORY, pg. 17

Screw, until its somewhat mysterious introduc-

1960s discussed birth control and abortion, and
the first class on human sexuality was offered in
the 19705. Attitudes toward homosexual dating
also changed in the 19705. When Frost first
arrived at Swarthmore in 1973, homosexual dating was not something he was hearing about, but
within three years, it was.
Somewhere along the line, sex evolved into a
brazenly accepted facet of college life. The demise
of formal dating seems to have been a consequence of this new leniency, yet somehow
Swatties survived for several decades without

that the demise of prudeness and the forward
press of the sexual revolution was subject to an
inescapable, foolishly resisted historical force, it
would be good to strike a tempering note here.
The Phoenix of 1963 sympathized with "the
general feeling of the student body concerning
the lack of sufficient social facilities conducive to
'a pleasant study atmosphere a deux' which is
especially relevant Saturday nights when the
library is closed."
Looks like some things haven't changed.

On being sketchy
BY MATTHEW FITTING
mfittinl@swarthmore.edu

Party associates and trailer trash have at least one thing in common:
Each should be made to hang signs outside their respective territory,
offering caution to those going inside. Just as the population af
Bumblewood, Tenn., must put up "Beware of dog" signs for the safety of
visitors, so too should PAs, with concern for their fellow Swatties at heart,
post their own three-word signs, each a last-minute reminder to drunken,
repressed, horny Saturday night partygoers all across campus: Beware of
the sketchy.
Despite its ambiguity as a descriptor, sketch is often the label of sexual death. It's a term that, once attached, will stick around like the bitter,
lingering aftertaste of that banana-flavored condom pocketed at the Sexual
Health Counselors' party last November.
Everyone might not share the same opinion as to what "sketchy" is, but
all are well aware that it's everywhere you don't want to be. And, as everyone also knows, the quickest path to sketchiness is participation in
sketchy activities with those who've already earned the label.

The sketchy are as obvious as the fact that,,.
when the Worth lady tells you the lubricant
costs $l5O, you can give her just a quarter
and walk out of there with no questions asked.
Pretending this is

your average sixth

grade

essay, let s turn to the dic-

tionary, where we find the following under "sketchy": Lacking in substance or completeness; incomplete. Like George Bush or Al Bloom, like
Regis and Kathie Lee, the sketchy are marked by that feeling of falseness
you get when you find yourself in their presence. You can't help asking
why these people are smiling all the damn time. They want something
from you; you're sure of that. They just haven't let you in on what that
something is exactly.
But take heart, all you weary of the more seasoned sketchsters abumpin' and a -grindin' next to you .at that Paces party. There are signs,
clues; there are tip-offs. If you know how to spot them, the sketchy are as
obvious as the fact that when the Worth lady tells you the lubricant costs
SLSO, you can give her just a quarter and walk out of there with no questions asked.
Granted, it is often hard to find the sketchy among us, not because they
conceal themselves particularly well, but because too many of the nonsketchy are attaching the wrong definition to the word itself. Somewhere
along the way, "shady" and "sketchy"
got mixed
not the same thing
up, and the latter term was the one everybody took to. Much confusion has
ensued.
Be careful. An incorrect or inexact definition of "sketchy" can be as
dangerous as not knowing a definition at all. "Shady" is unkempt, a little
uninterested in societal contact. Not like SWIL; I mean more in that Worth
sense, people who are just a little too cool to take part in actual contact
with other human beings. The sketchy have no such problem they're all
too interested in such contact, of the sort where the aforementioned lubricant becomes the most important person in the room.
But back to stopping the sketchy before that lubricant enters into the
equation. "Incomplete" is exactly the right word people who seem to be
missing something that a normal person would normally have, like a
motive for dancing with you, or underwear, for example.
Take your average dance partner. Wondering why that girl was humping the wall before you started dancing with her? Why won't that guy tell
you where his hand is? The sketchy thrive on those who are firm believers in the Fifth Amendment they live on the hope that you won't ask too
many questions. Don't let the possibly sketchy escape without giving an
explanation, else they will live to sketch again.
So beware, all you who unknowingly wander into the sketchy's most
favored spots, like Paces or Upper Tarble, or the dorm room of any Sixteen
Feet member. Though easy to spot and possible to keep at bay with proper preparation (a discussion of your favorite Psalm should do the trick),
without warning the sketchy can attack, with their seedy motives and lascivious plans.
And when you walk out of the party with that girl whose name you
barely remember or that guy who you know is really great from all the
conversations you've had online, that same PA who didn't warn you will
turn his head, watch you go, and know that from then on the word will
trail behind you like a lubricated Trojan stuck to the sole of your shoe.
From that moment on, you're one yourself. You, too, have entered the
realm of the sketchy.

Committee might increase staff privacy
From PRIVACY, pg. 5
and computing facilities, may not be used

and from memfor surveillance.
bers of the college community must not be
intercepted or monitored, nor information
about the origin or destination of messages
collected. Information fortuitously gained
by those operating the communications system should not be passed on to others."
Messages to

According to math professor and associate provost for information technology Steve
Mauser '67, the policy uses the language "all
members of the college community" because
the faculty handbook used to be the only policy handbook at the college.

The student handbook has no mention of
electronic communications such as
Internet use, chatting, or e-mail in its section on privacy.
Maurer said the committee should look
at the discrepancy between the policy laid
out in the faculty and staff handbooks.
According to him, the two "are very different in tone and, I think, contradictory."
Young, who oversees the dissemination
of the college policy to staff, emphasized that
the staff policy is not intended to allow for
regular surveillance.

"All we are saying is that if we have a
need, a business need, to look, we will," said
Young. "And that's all."
Business needs, she said, would include
anything essential to the functioning of the
college, for example, if a staff member is ill
and someone needs to retrieve an important
file.

"All we are saying is that if
we have a need, a business
need, to look, we will.
And that's all."

Melanie Young
As a practice, the college does not monianyone's specific communications,
Information Technology Services said.
According to ITS director Judy Downing,
"Operationally, on a software monitoring
level, there is no difference" in faculty, staff

tor

and student privacy.

Human Resources has recently been distributing the new staff handbook, and it has
alerted staff to the policy on electronic pri-

vacy. Young said that most staff members
have accepted the new policy, while a few

have expressed discomfort.
Kae Kalwaic, who works in the education
department office, knew of the new policy
but was unaware of the discrepancy with
faculty policy.

Kalwaic called the policies unfair. "I
value what I do as much as I think a faculty
member values what they do," she said.
"The lower you get on the pay scale the less
trust there is."
Young insisted that staff policy is not
about a lack of trust. "We trust people here.
We don't routinely look at their e-mail, we
don't routinely look in their computers," she
said. Such a policy, she added, "is expressing
trust in employees."
According to both Maurer and Young, the
college must also balance issues of privacy
with both proper functioning of the college
and liability issues. "We have to make sure
we don't cripple the institution's ability to
stay viable, and that's all that the policy is
intended to do," Young said.

Liability concerns could prompt a
stricter college policy than faculty would
like to see. Still, Maurer said that a new faculty policy that resembles the staff policy

would likely never I

I

pass a faculty vote.
"I think we would
cause an uproar if
we proposed such
a thing," he said.
Maurer said
the EPC, in addition to covering
staff and faculty
issues, may also

reconsider policy
for staff.
PI
The EPC curMelanie Young, assorently contains no ciate vice president
staff members, but I for human resources
does have one student representative. Maurer said staff were
never considered for possible committee
membership. "The issue just didn't arise,"
he said.
Young insisted that, despite the difference in language, the issues on faculty, staff
and student policy on electronic privacy are
very much similar.
Still, she saw no reason to amend the
staff policy. "I don't know anything today
that would make me think it would be a good
idea to change it," she said.

Against No. 2 Gettysburg,

crushing the Tide 16-4 Saturday.
The Bullets raced out to a 2-0 lead in the first
minute and never looked back, taking advantage of a
slow-starting Swarthmore team. The Garnet Tide
offense struggled to create opportunities early in the
game, failing to manage a single shot in the first
quarter and taking only 19 on the game to the Bullets'
48.
Despite being overwhelmed by the Bullets by an 81 score at halftime, Swarthmore battled back and
kept pace with Gettysburg in the third quarter. Both
teams managed two goals in the period, and the Tide
outshot the Bullets 7-6.
But the Bullets stormed back in the fourth period,
swamping Swarthmore 6-1 and running the final tally
to 16-4. The Tide defense was unable to control
Gettysburg's dangerous attack trio of Jake Van
Nostrand, Ric Bremer and Pete Milliman. The three
combined for 11 goals and six assists.
Turnovers plagued the Swarthmore attack, with the
team committing 24 on the game. Those problems were
particularly bad on clears, where the team ran into dif-

feel that the players will holdthe
attention of the media this season instead of the individual
teams. With the threat of a lockout looming large at the end of
the World Series, fans should
take advantage of a summer that
will be marked with personal

achievements.
Of course, like every year,
the New York teams will draw
media attention. Yankees first
baseman Jason Giambi faces the
expectations of at least a 40home run season; pitcher David
Wells will delight and possibly
enrage the baseball world with
his wild antics; and the Yankees
themselves will be under close
scrutiny as they attempt to
regain the crown. The Mets, too,
will receive their fair share of
attention. With a lineup featuring All-Stars Mike Piazza,
Roberto Alomar and Mo Vaughn
anchoring the infield, the Mets
will keep the baseball world's
attention as they try to dethrone
the Atlanta Braves, who have
not lost the NL East pennant
since the first Bush administration.
Sluggers Barry Bonds and
Sammy Sosa will once again provide the charisma for a season of
longballs. Bonds is facing a follow-up to one of the greatest seasons in baseball history. It's
doubtful that he'll get to 73 home
runs again, but the San

Blake Atkins 'O2, Joseph DeSimone 'O4, John
Murphy 'O3 and Tim Chryssikos 'O5 each contributed
a goal, and Atkins and Than Court 'O3 chipped in an
assist each. But the attack could not convert a scoring opportunity until 4:30 remained in the second
quarter, when Atkins finally broke the Bullets'
defense.
"Turnovers kept us from doing much offensively,"
head coach Pat Gress said. "We didn't clear the ball
too well and just made a lot of mistakes offensively."
Gress called the team's defense in set positions the
"highlight" of the game for Swarthmore, noting that
most of Gettysburg's goals came off failed clears and
transition situations.
"We weren't as ready as we should have been,"
Gress said. "We'll work on our clearing to more
opportunities on offense, and we'll work on some possession exercises to cut turnovers."
The Tide's first opportunity to bounce back from
the loss was at York College, a team Gress deemed
"very similar to us," Wednesday afternoon. The
results of the game were not available at press time.
The Garnet Tide next take on No. 11 Western
Maryland Saturday at 1:30 p.m. Swarthmore will venture to Maryland with the hope that they can repeat
their third-quarter performance against Gettysburg.
"We put forth maximum effort and never gave
up," Gress said. "For 15 minutes we went out and
played a 2-2 game with the No. 2 team in the country."

Francisco Giant has a realistic
shot at eventually reaching
Hank Aaron's all-time record of
755. The countdown begins on
opening day. With the addition
of outfielder Moises Alou, the
Chicago Cubs have finally provided Sosa with some real protection in the lineup. He could
easily hit 70 homers if pitchers
actually have to pitch to him
this year.

Of course, there will also be

the stories of Texas's Randy
Johnson and Seattle's Ichiro
Suzuki. The Big Unit will try

once again to reach that single
season record of 393 strikeouts,
and Ichiro will shoot for the
record of 257 hits.
However, this season's rookies will hold the spotlight. Four
top-rated prospects aim to make
a powerful first impression this

season as Hank Blalock, Nick
Johnson, Adam Dunn and Josh
Beckett will all play full seasons
for the Texas Rangers, the
Yankees, the Cincinnati Reds
and the Marlins, respectively.
These four will usher in a new
era of players destined for stardom.
So that's it. Watch the games
this year. Enjoy baseball while
it's still here. With luck, the

owners won't shut it down in the
off-season, but we can never
take that for granted.
And, finally, what good would

a baseball preview column be
without a prediction? Here's
mine: a classic World Series featuring the Yankees over the St.
Louis Cardinals in six games.

Baseball drops conference opener 5-2
BY MARK JANOFF
mjanoffl@swarthmore.edu
"I think the team is lacking the one game where
everything comes together," tri-captain Scott
Kushner 'O2 said following Swarthmore's 5-2 loss to
Washington yesterday. Despite outplaying the
Shoremen in many facets of the game, the Garnet
failed to piece together nine innings of solid baseball
and dropped their first Centennial Conference
matchup of the season.
Starting pitcher Jared Leiderman 'O5 gave up
only two earned runs on six hits, but the Garnet
defense committed six errors leading to three additional Washington scores. "What we need to do is
keep plugging," Leiderman said. "We have a lot of
good young players. It's gonna come."
"Our pitching kept us in it," Kushner added.
Leiderman endured the cold weather to pitch his
second complete game of the season. "By throwing,
you manage to stay warm," he joked.
Another standout was tri-captain Matt Goldstein
'O4, who was 2-4 on the day and sparked a late
Swarthmore rally with an RBI single in the eighth
inning. But
Goldstein's heroics could not
overshadow the Garnet's lack of clutch hitting.
Swarthmore left nine men on base, including three
in the bottom of the eighth.
Infielder Bill Farrell 'O5 started the rally with a
two-out base hit to right field. Goldstein drove in
Farrell following a Joe Corso 'O2 walk, and Ryan

Chahrour 'O4 then loaded the bases with a walk of
his own, forcing a Washington pitching change. The
new pitcher walked in a run by hitting Jody Fisher
'O5 with a pitch before striking out Wes Sconce 'O4 to
end the inning. The rally closed the Garnet deficit to
5-2, but the team failed to get on base in the ninth
inning.

"The one thing that I think is lacking is

...

con-

sistency in confidence," Kushner said. Swarthmore
managed to summon confidence during the eighthinning rally, but they failed to come through in other

clutch situations. That inconsistency has cost the
Garnet throughout the season. They committed six
errors in a 6-5 loss to the University of the Sciences
and four in a 10-5 loss to Wesleyan.
If the Garnet manage to be consistent in just one
game and string together nine strong innings, that
may be enough to get them on a roll, Kushner
thinks. "We don't have guys on this team that are
used to winning," Kushner said. "We have some guys
that haven't even won a collegiate game, and our
sophomores have only won five games. Until they get
that taste of winning" the Garnet will have problems
meeting their potential.
"This is the kind of game that should instill confidence and still get people worried," Kushner said.
"This being our first conference game, we saw
their best pitcher, and we saw that he wasn't very

good."
Washington's starter had a four-hit shutout

Third baseman Ryan Pannorfi leads off the ninth inning Wednesday against Washington, who beat the Garnet 5-2
through seven innings, but the Garnet bats were
ripping him at times. In the bottom of the fifth
inning, Kushner and Brandon King 'O5 hit deep
fly balls, and Farrell belted a line drive to second
base. But Swarthmore could not take advantage
of the fatigued Washington starter in the sixth
and seventh innings.
The Garnet face the Shoremen again on
Friday, and Kushner hopes they will get going
then. "I came in with very, very high expectations for this team," he said. "I'm still confident
that we're a team that can throw some wins
together and get to the playoffs."

Women's rugby has been blooming with pride since Saturday, when an 8-7 win over The College of
New Jersey (TCNJ) kept up Swarthmore's undefeated season. Both the A-side and the B-side matches fea-

tured tough competition and Swattie heroics.
In the A-side game, the Swarthmore ruggers adjusted quickly to the new rule change regarding
scrum engagement. The Garnet came out hard-hitting but were called on illegal high tackles. TCNJ
opened up the scoring off a penalty try and proceeded to successfully kick the two point conversion.
However, the Swarthmore ruggers, with scrum half Rabi Whitaker 'O3, defeated all of TCNJ's hopes of
scoring again. Maya Peterson 'O2 scored the sole try of the game to put Swarthmore on the board, and
Sarah Nusser 'O2 made a gravity-defying penalty kick to put the Tide ahead for good. Final score:
Swarthmore 8, TCNJ 7.
The B-side game started out rough, with TCNJ scoring within the first couple of minutes. But the
indomitable Garnet B-side showed the Lions how fleeting victory can be when forward Aja Peters-Mason
'O4, scrum half Laura Louison 'O2, captain Katie Harper 'O2, Karly Ford 'O3 and Liana Lum 'O3 combined
for five tries. Harper made one conversion, leaving the score at 27-5. Though veterans scored all the tries,
the rookies played with the necessary aggression to make the win possible.
With two wins under their belt, the Swat ruggers will host Temple on Saturday at 11 a.m. on
Cunningham Fields.

Garnet downs Vassar 14-4 in warmup match
Tide to open tough
conference season

BY KATHRYN JANTZ
kjantzl@swarthmore.edu
Much to the regret of the Garnet
women, last weekend's Seven Sisters
Lacrosse Tournament at Smith CoUege was
cancelled due to snow. To get a much needed game in before yesterday's conference
opener at Franklin & Marshall, head coach
Karen Borbee quickly scheduled a game
against Vassar College, who was also planning on attending the tourney. After the
four-hour trek to Poughkeepsie and some
last-minute lines adjustments, the Tide was
victorious by a score of 14-4.
"The cancellation was bad," tri-captain
Mavis Biss 'O2 said. "We were just anxious
to get some games, but having the Vassar
game was good. We were glad to at least get
a game in."
Tri-captain Katie Tarr scored five goals
and had two assists, while Mariam Levy 'O2
and Biss scored three goals each. One of
Levy's tallies was off a bizarre play where
a lobbed over-the-goal pass sneaked past
Sarah Lackay, the Vassar goalkeeper. Kim
Cariello 'O2 added two goals to the

Swarthmore effort, and Liz Brainard 'O3
scored once.
The game was a much-needed chance
for the team to continue working as a
coherent unit. After a scattered first half
plagued with unforced Garnet turnovers,
the Garnet led 5-2. After a halftime talk
from Borbee, the offense came together and
scored nine second-half goals.
While the offense was settling down, the
solid Garnet defense kept Vassar from scoring and Swarthmore in control. Goalie
Jennifer Hart 'O3 made 10 saves in the net,
while the seasoned core defenders
Heather Kile 'O2, Carly Hammond 'O2, Meg
Woodworth 'O3 and Kate Nelson-Lee 'O3
consistently shut down the Vassar fast
breaks. The Tide shot 14-for-38, while
Vassar shot only 4-for-2L

"They are big conference rivals, and it is
frustrating that they are at the beginning of
the season, particularly because of so many
cancelled games," Brainard said. "Thus far

plan on going out strong and having fun."

The logical response at first seems to be that the political

lock out the players over labor negotiations until after the
