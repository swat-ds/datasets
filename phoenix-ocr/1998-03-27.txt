Managers Close Olde Club Citing

Structural Concerns, Vandalism
by Nate Stulman
In an attempt to bring a number of concerns to
the attention of various members of the college
community, the managers ofOlde Club have temporarily closed the space to student parties. Specifically, Olde Club management wants to send a
message to the physical
plant that the building has
structural problems that are
not being properly addressed and have raised
safety concerns. They also
want students to understand
that the management will no
longer tolerate vandalism
and reckless disregard for
Olde Club.
JasonRothenberg '9B, Director of the club, explains
that Olde Club management decided to close the
building to student parties indefinitely after the
weekend ofFebruary 27, during which there were
a number of particularly destructive episodes.
"What was most offensive was that it was three
separate occasions when holes were punched in
the wall," says Rothenberg. "Also, parts of the ceiling are falling down, the basement is consistently
flooding, and the staircase is in need of repair. It
just got to the point where there were safety haz-

ards."
Rothenberg and the managers, after consulting
with Coordinator of Student Activities Davirah
Timm-Dinkins, decided to close the space, a move
they believed was necessary for raising awareness
ofOlde Club's physical problems. Rothenberg said
he did not believe that any parties were canceled
at the last minute as a result of the closure decision.
"The point was to send a message to college
community and to the physical plant that we do
care about the space. The physical plant was responsive and is trying to fix the problems," says
Rothenberg, who notes that Olde Club will be open
and hosting parties beginning next weekend, although repairs have yet to be made.
According to Larry Schall, Vice President for

Facilities and Services, most ofOlde Club's problems are not structural. He says the only structural
damage is to a curved wooden railing on the staircase between the basement and the second floor.
"I would say the rail is not safe," says Schall.
"While not ready to fall off, [the railing] is certainly not able to support the loads required to meet
today's codes or take much
more abuse." Schall says a
plan is being devised to replace the current railing with
a railing reinforced with
steel, but a "fix" is not likely
before summer.
Unlike the Delta Upsilon
fraternity, Olde Club is an
all-campus space that, theoretically, can be reserved by
anyone. However, Olde Club
reservations coordinator
Shirley Salmeron '9B has the ability to select which
groups can use the space and, since the end ofFebruary, has decided not to take party reservations.
Only live band performances, coordinated by
Rothenberg, have been allowed in the space during March.
Rothenberg and the co-managers have decided
to initiate new rules for organizations and students
who holdparties at Olde Club. "In the past, groups
have had to give us a deposit but some groups have
been lax. From now on they will be required to
give us a deposit [and] sign a contract, agreeing to
clean the building after the party," says Rothenberg.
Coordinators are clearly hoping that stricter rules
will lead to an increased use of Olde Club. Says
Timm-Dinkins, "We're hoping that the space will
be used more and more for a variety of purposes
for functions like dinner parties for instance."
There is no estimate as to how much it will cost
to repair Olde Club's damages. The physical plant
has indicated that some repairs will take place in
the coming weeks, while others will be postponed
until summer.

questioning.

The same man had been spotted in the library by
References Librarian Ed Fuller on Wednesday night.
At around 7:00 p.m., Fuller encountered the suspect
loitering in the space between the periodicals stack
and the staff lounge on the third floor. His behavior,
Fuller described, "was what would be traditionally
described as suspicious." He proceeded to greet the
suspect, who replied hastily and subsequently turned
around to "fiddle with something" on the sorting shelf.
The suspect's response resembled that of a kid "who
got caught doing something by his mother," Fuller recalled. Fuller thereafter entered the staff lounge and
called the receptionist on duty, Ben Criscuolo, to notify him of the suspect's presence, who promptly informed Public Safety.
Public Safety records show that officers were dispatched to the library at around the same time. According to Fuller, Criscuolo witnessed the same person leave the library empty-handed later on that night.
Criscuolo could not be reached for comment at press
time. It is unknown at this point whether the suspect
left before or after Public Safety reached the scene of
the incident.

Panel Discusses

Swarthmore Engineers did the College
proud last Saturday as their mechanical
mouse clinched first place yet again in the
yearly lEEE Region II MicroMouse competition. The Garnet Tide also took top honors
last year. Students are asked to create a robot
which can navigate any given maze quickly.

In a joint effort by the Pro-Choice Task
Force (PCTF) and Swarthmore Students Advocating Life (SSAL), a pregnancy resources
forum was held on campus Tuesday evening.
Panelists included Rachel Schuchardt '94,
representing pregnant and parenting students
at Swarthmore, Dr. David Ramirez, Director
of Psychological Services, Tedd Goundie, Associate Dean for Student Life, Julie
Schwendiman '99, co-President of SSAL,
Rebecca Green '9B, coordinator of Reproductive Health Counseling and representative of
PCTF, Myrt Westphal, Director ofResidential Life and Assistant Dean of the College,
and Beth Kotarski, R.N., representative of
Worth Health Center. The panel was moderated by Serrin Foster, Executive Director of
Feminists for Life.
Foster opened the panel by clarifying that
the aim of the evening was not to debate abortion, but rather to "evaluate resources and
develop a blueprint to support pregnant and
parenting students and that includes fathers."
Foster proposed that audience members keep
a running list as panelists spoke of "reasonable, creative, cost-effective solutions to help
students in need" that are already in place at
Swarthmore.
Schuchardt, who was seated beside her four
year old daughter, was the first panelist to
speak. She told of becoming pregnant as a
married junior at Swarthmore and her decisee Pregnanacy, page 4

Staff Optimistic As Recommendation Deadline Approaches
by Emily Shartin

INSIDE THIS WEEK

On Thursday, an unidentified man was taken into custody for questioning in connection to last week's laptop
thefts at McCabe Library. College Public Safety confronted the man at approximately 3 p.m. in McCabe after he was identified by another patron in the library. No
personal identification was found on the individual when
he was taken into custody, and he reportedly provided
officers with conflicting names and addresses. "He
doesn't seem to be cooperating," said Director ofPublic
Safety Owen Redgrave.
Shortly after taking the man into custody, College Public Safety transferred him to Swarthmore borough police. Redgrave speculated that borough officers would
probably have to release the suspect, but at press time,
Swarthmore borough police would not comment on the
situation.
According to library staff, the suspect, a scantily
bearded African-American male wearing a cap, tried to
enter the library as part of a tour group Thursday afternoon. He did not sign in with the receptionist and apparently broke away from the tour group after entering the
library.
Wilson Kello '9B was sitting outside McCabe when
the suspect was led outside by two plain-clothes personnel at around 3:40p.m. Kello reports that two uniformed
officers were waiting for the party by a Public Safety
jeep parked in the Parrish traffic circle. After the two
groups joined, the foursome began to question the sus-

Soon after, a Swarthmore borough police car arrived
on the scene as well. The two borough officers started
interrogating the suspect themselves, at one point frisking him. Approximately half an hour after the suspect
was brought out from the library, Public Safety handed
him over to borough police, who handcuffed him and
took him back to the Swarthmore station for further

As the deadline for long-range planning recommendations draws closer, membersof the Swarthmore community are continuing to campaign on behalfof the College staff, and are increasingly hopeful that their efforts will not go unnoticed.
Integral in the current discussions is a small group of
staff, faculty, and students that came together early in
the year and has since come to be known as the "ad
hoc" staff experience committee. In a letter distributed
to several groups on campus in January, the informal
committee outlined several issues that it felt needed to
be addressed by the Staffing Long-Range Planning
Committee (SLRPC). Among the concerns listed were
the grievance procedure, pay and benefits issues, and
the hierarchical structure of the College.
Vice President for Finance and Planning Paul
Aslanian, who is also a member of the SLRPC, believes
that discussions about various staffing issues were long
overdue. "Staff are absolutely crucial to our success,"
he says, noting that for the three years he has been at
Swarthmore he has been very interested in addressing
issues of staff treatment.
Aslanian also concedes that while the College has
spent huge amounts of time addressing faculty and student concerns, "We really haven't paid the same degree of attention to the staff issue."
But so far staff members are encouraged by the efforts that have been put into addressing staff concerns,
not to mention the overflow turnouts at the threerecent
SLRPC open meetings. "The long-range planning process has really opened the door for this," says Director
ofPublications JeffLott. "It took a strong approach by
[the ad hoc committee] t0... really kick the doors wide

open, and now that that's happened I think there's a lot
of interest in staff issues."
According to Professor of Russian and longtime labor activist Thompson Bradley, these most recent initiatives have emerged out of a lengthy history of labor
activism at Swarthmore. While current staff members
are not as interested in efforts like the campus union
drives of the 19705, a series of surveys on staffing issues over the past few years indicated to Bradley and
others that some changes needed to be made with regard to staff treatment. In 1996, Bradley and a group of
administrative assistants began meeting together and
eventually presented their concerns to Provost Jennie
Keith. This small group provided the foundations for
the present ad hoc committee.
One of the primary concerns that the SLRPC has been
looking into is the issue of staff wages and benefits.
"[Swarthmore can] be a leader in setting what these jobs
should pay," says Kae Kalwaic, leader of the ad hoc
committee and an administrative assistant for the Program in Education. "Do we have to pay [staff] what
everybody else pays them? Why not give them a good
living wage... and value the job they do?" Bradley
agrees, but believes that this kind of financial reallocation would mandate a difficult shift in priorities on the
part of administration, faculty, and especially students.
"Things like a new dormitory, a student center are probably, as far as I'm concerned, unfortunately going to
take precedence," he says, "unless students say 'we think
actually the pay is more importantfor people who work
here than a student center or a dormitory.'"
"Given the charge of Swarthmore College
the
charge that they give the students of social responsibility and social justice and Quaker values," says Kalwaic,
"in keeping in the same spirit with that... we can work

as a community to resolve [these] issues."
Many staffmembers are also concerned with the status of the Committee on Staff Procedures (COSP), a
group that advises the President on staff issues and is
currently managed by Human Resources. "What is on
everybody's mind," according to Bradley, "is... will the
Committee on Staff Procedures become a significant
body which will have some influence in dealing with
very important staff issues?"
"COSP will always remain advisory to the president,"
believes Lott, a COSP member. "I don't see COSP
becoming a staff senate... it's a forum for the discussion of important issues faced by staff, and for transmitting ideas about those issues to the senior staffand
to the president." Nonetheless, Lott and others are currently in the process of attempting to reorganize COSP
so that it will be more beneficial to staff members.
"There are discussions being held about restructuring
COSP so that employees would have more confidence
that it was a good voice for them in representing staff
issues... [the issue is] what kind of access we have to
the decision-makers." To this end, the group recently
submitted a proposal for the reorganization of COSP
to Human Resources, but has agreed not to talk about
it publicly while a decision is pending.
Kalwaic wonders more generally what role committee recommendations play, noting that sometimes committees will work on proposals all year only to have
them completely ignored by those in decision-making
positions. She believes that communication is an important issue to address, especially as she and others
begin to work on revising staff grievance procedures.

Many Roles, Few Actors
Swarthmore, small college that it is, offers many positions of responsibility for students to fill, and few students interested in filling them. The
result is thatrather than people holding single positions, many of those in
the positions of greatest responsibility and power hold multiple posts. This
concentration of power can at times be highly beneficial, for example
Vincent Jones and Ryan Peterson were able to quickly spearhead a campaign to improve food services because of their multiple responsibilities.
In the overly bureaucratic wasteland that Swarthmore can often become,
sometimes the only way to cut through red tape is to be the people who
control the red tape. In addition, a student who holds multiple positions
will be seen as more deserving of respect from the administrationand a ear
than the sum of the individuals who would otherwise hold the positions.
At the same time, this phenomenon raises great concern. The concentration of power in the hands of a select few often is worrisome in that it
grants those people more of an ability to regulate policy based upon their
own personal interests. For example, students with significant power can
work (though without popular support) in favor or unpopular programs or
personal agendas. They can also bog down campaigns brought by uninvolved
but concerned students. For example, the food services campaign might
not have been as successful or proceeded so quickly had it not been organized by Peterson and Jones. Fortunately it was, as the two acted in a highly
responsive and responsible manner that can be regarded as a model for
such action. They used their power and influence responsibly, making the
most of them for the good of the community. At the same time though,
students should be aware that the concentration of power in the hands of a
relatively few students, who deserve it as the only ones interested in doing
the job, has downsides. Not only can it lead to the promotion of personal
agendas, it also can lead to incredible conflicts of interest of the part of the
holders of multiple positions. The solution is relatively simple however,
those concerned by this phenomenon should simply run for positions themselves.

Lay Some Cable
For years, Swatties have noticed that students on other campuses enjoy
more of the comforts ofhome than we do. This semester, some students
have taken it upon themselves to make change happen in a real way.
The past couple of weeks have seen several changes that have noticenamely, the extension
ably increased the quality oflife on this campus
of full Tarble credit and the trial period of extended library hours. We'd
like to point out another effort going on now that needs student support.
SUCK, or Swarthmore United for Cable Konsumption, wants to bring
cable into the lounges of every dorm on campus.
The advantages of cable are self-evident, ranging from the practical to
philosophical. No argument needs to be made as to the benefits of acceptable TV reception in the lounges. Swatties have been forced to stare at
snowy TV pictures and have been unable to get many valuable programs
only on cable for too long. Self-contained as the community already is,
students risk further ignorance by their limited access to one of the most
important sources ofinformation. How can the future leaders ofthe world
lead without knowing what goes on in the rest of the world? Let's be real:
who has the time to read the paper?) When will Swatties have the chance
to actually use their hard-earned knowledge to analyze contemporary real
world events?
And the list goes on. Whatever drawbacks cable may pose and we
see none: Swatties will study hard even if an earthquake of Richter scale
100.0 hits McCabe
are far outweighed by its potential benefits.
We are, after all, working harder than anyone else in the country, so we
better try to enjoy life while we're ar it.

Clarification

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Basenese Punishment Prevents True Reconciliation
To the Editor.
It has been three weeks now since the day that
one of my best friends was suspended from Swarthmore. What compels me to write is not that
this suspension was unwarranted, but rather the
way in which his punishment was handled. My
friend was found guilty ofboth intimidation and
assault, and although I disagree with his behavior, I am appalled by the decisions our school's
administration made in dealing with the matter.
You see, my friend is only suspended for this
semester, but never again will he return to our
school. I believe that by attempting to solve this
case ofphysical intimidation, our administration
has in fact advocated a different kind of intimidation which affects us all.
First, we should recognize certain important
events that followed the incident. From the moment my friend realized what he had done, he
was extremely regretful. As aresult, he tried numerous times to make contact with the victim to
apologize and express this regret. These efforts
were abolished by the administration, however,
and subsequently forced his removal from campus. The situationbecame more serious because
it got more and more blown out of proportion

with each day. Parental influence was allowed
to be brought into the picture, but at no time
were the two students allowed to meet and
work out their problems. The student judicial committee met, with the victim claiming
that he could no longer feel safe attending
Swarthmore while my friend was still here.
On several occasions my friend admitted his
guilt and simply asked for forgiveness; moreover, he volunteered to get help and spend time
doing community service. The administration ultimately decided upon suspension for
the rest of this semester and probation for next
year, but my friend has decided not to return.
Can any of us really blame him? Why should
he return, knowing that his future lies in the
hands of the "comfort level" of just one other
student
and to a place thatrefuses to let its
students work out their problems together.
My friend definitely has and will continue
to learnfrom what happened, but I believe that
the victim and our administration also need
to learn from this incident, as well. They
should realize that there will never be an institutional system that separates everyone
from all of their individual problems. Sooner

be represented.
Second, on a more personal level, what gives us
the right to censor the Phoenix? We all do not have
to agree on every topic to hit campus but we all deserve the right to express our opinions. That is the
want to

job of the Phoenix to report the stories and issues
on campus. I say, sit tight and let them do their job.

this, I find it absurd that at Monday's meeting, SC
voted her deceptive actions acceptable. She claimed
she was trying to inform, not influence but it is perfectly clear in her letter that when she demands for
action to taken, she has gone beyond simple information.
Why can't we all present our personal issues before the Board of Managers? I know 275 people expressed concern over the CJC hearing before spring
break. For some reason, that issue never reached the
Board of Managers. Maybe that's because it was not
an issue that Laura cared about. Maybe because it's
not her job to present issues. We, the students of

Laura Barandes '99 was elected as our Observer to

the happenings of their meetings and report back to

the proposition for censorship of the
Phoenix
without consulting with the rest of Student Council. Furthermore, she signed her 7 page
document as the "Student Council Representative to
the Board of Managers."
I find two things disturbing about her actions. First,
on a community level, I feel Barandes has overstepped
her bounds. She presented the illusion that she was
representing us, the Swarthmore Community, while
in actuality, she was representing the views of a select few, namely close friends. She never even discussed her proposal with the remainder of SC. For

confrontation. The administration has certainly done nothing to educate the victim, and
as a result, the victim, my friend, and the social cohesiveness of our community has suffered. Essentially, there is no way that any
of us can help to "heal" our wounded community, because this healing must involve
people working out their differences on their
own. True "healing" requires the conversations that the administration specifically denied my friend. It is precisely this lack of
social interaction at Swarthmore that causes
my friend to fear a return to our community,
and instead look for another school to attend
next fall. It is therefore sadly ironic that the
administration cannot expect any "healing",
for they have provided a precedence that
makes it impossible. The administration here
at Swarthmore has suspended my friend for
not thinking through the consequences prior
to his actions, yet they are guilty of the same
offense.

Effective
Oppression

by Bryan Gobin

;I

once asked a guy to bring me flowers
I was dating him, so it wasn't that
but when he showed up with
strange
flowers it wasn't very exciting. I didn'tfeel
particularly loved, or desired, or cherished.
I felt like I had won, or that he could follow directions, but that's not what I wanted
\vhen I asked for them
and so I never
really had my need fulfilled. I have to wonder if this new rage of Swarthmore groups
or individual students demanding apologies
is destined for such unromantic, unsatisfied, fate. The apology is like romantic
flowers
it's a nice idea if it comes from
the heart and not from nagging. An apology isn't all it's cracked up to be if you
have to demand it. You may have won, but
that doesn't mean that you're right.
-Let's take the old Swarthmore debate
about affirmative action. On February 17,
a Daily Gazette article reported that Ryan
Peterson would issue an apology for his
"insensitive" statement that "several students had expressed concern that academic
quality has suffered because of the
College's policy of bringing in diverse students." I am lead to believe that this apology is not unsolicited.
Please allow me, and not Ryan Peterson,
to, take responsibility for a view that I
(along with others) hold. I am willing to
take responsibility for my words
and
don't expect an apology. I am one of the
people who believe that taking race into
account (or gender for that matter) when

I grew up in a small Florida town with a
daily newspaper called the Playground
Daily News. Who the hell would have ever
expected that I would eventually attend an
elite institution. I grudged through two
years of shitwork in the New Orleans hotel industry before I received a job offer
for S3OK. After four years of academic
pain and suffering, I do not expect to make
much more than that in the job market so
my education really cost me $l2OK+ in
forgone income plus thousands more in
loans.Like most everybody else my GPA
needscardio-resuscitation. Was it worthit?
Hell yeah!
I did not get involved in campus politics
or much of anything else while at Swarthmore, so in some ways that's probably not
what the Admission people wanted.
Frankly I don't give a shit about the
College's investments in McDonald's,
marginalization in the faculty lounge, or
why some drunken undergraduate conducts his excreting activities on RA doors
instead of the restroom. These things were

making admissions decisions has caused
academic quality to suffer. I am against allowing race and/or gender to play a role in
the admissions process because I think that
doing so hurts the school far more than it
could ever help.
So what happens now? Chances are, I've
just offended people. I'm not totally sure
why
I haven't said that any particular
person doesn't belong at Swarthmore. I
haven't said, "All students of color have
beeji admitted because they are students of
color."' Indeed anyone who thinks that is
what I'm saying clearly (to me) has extrapolated well beyond what is reasonable.
l'm sure that I've offended
sjjmeone. You, the offended, seem to have
several options. Recently, one of those options seems to have gained enormous popularity: you could make me apologize. You
ceuld even threaten Student Council action
(ajkempty threat for anyone who understands the oxymoron implicit in conjoiningjhese words, Student Council and actiejrjO. You could come over to Oxford and
get my college to take away my bar
privileges. Perhaps after such drastic action, I'd apologize maybe even buy you
seme flowers. You feel better now? I still
think that considering race and/or gender
fpr admissions results in lowering academic quality. However, you're happy because you've been told what you want to
hear. It's strange, because I could insult you
if ;I wanted and that's not the way I
would do it. Actually, the first thing I would
try-would be disingenuous comments
I'd lie to you because I didn't think that
you were worth the time and effort of the
truth. Or maybe I'd lie to you because you
told me that you weren't worth the time

fhat way if you like forced apologies
manage to make an insult where none existed in the first place. Are Swatties really
that masochistic?
; Or perhaps this is a better option for me:
!'I apologize now for anything that I ever
print, say or write which may offend
people. It was insensitive and should not
have been said." You know that to be horrible condescension. The sarcasm drips off
that apology. You know it, and therefore
you won't accept it. I don'tbelieve the sentiments in that apology any more than I

Until then, why are you asking for me to

energy that used to go into demanding
things and prove that you deserve to have

Race and The Staff Experience
by Lena Sze
How can we not consider race when we
consider any issue in this country? Race
is so deeply embedded in the nation's consciousness
either historical and contemthere are no social movements
porary
that can authentically be said to be separate from it. Why is race an issue that simply can't be forgotten? Because we are
surrounded everyday by the implications
and consequences of its part in the construction of social, economic, and political power dynamics. Because the memory
of past racial injustice and the sting of current racial prejudice is, after all, the feeling that lasts in the hearts of those who are
discriminated against and oppressed. The
impossibility of "forgetting" such a feeling is precisely what makes politics in general and progressive politics, in particular,
so frustrating to a person ofcolor who sees
the topic of race in many progressive (and
conservative) agendas being systematically
and dismissively replaced in the discussion
with talk ofa "color-blind" society at a time
when color is still very much an "issue."
What facets of Swarthmore College exemplify just such a superficial discussion
on race? What contentious struggles result
from the misunderstandings that arise out
of the discourse surrounding it? Admissions decisions, faculty hiring, alumni gifts,
curricular development, and staffissues are
all arenas in which a more substantial discussion about race and diversity could be
raised. Recent dialogue about the staff
experience at this school seems to affirm
for me the idea that issues of race, gender,
class, and other aspects of identity are inextricably connected.
Discussion about labor here at Swarthmore, as elsewhere, seems at once very
simple and complex. Writing as a person
who is interested in labor issues but just
beginning to develop a consciousness about
labor and learn about the intricacies and
dynamics of staff-non staff relationships,
Swarthmore seems to epitomize the problematic workplace, full of complicated and
intersecting issues. Swarthmore employees are not in a union; they express grievances about the treatment accorded and
respect given them by administration, faculty, and students. The obvious need to
address these issues in an open manner has
resulted in a dialogue that has been sustained by staffwith no widespread support
from students. The notion that "labor prac-

tices" at Swarthmore exist in a glass
bubble, unaware of and unresponsive to
outside realities needs to be challenged in
order for a truly inclusive and engaging
conversation about the staff experience to
occur and real improvement to be made.
When we discuss labor on this campus,
we need to talk about its racial component.
A great number of the workers with which
students interact on a day-to day basis are
African-American. The dining hall workers, the workers at Essie Mae's, and the
dorm housekeepers are the people who are
most visible as workers because they are
the ones that, as students, we cannot ignore because we eat and live where they
work. The invisibility of workers to students is marked at this school; just as we
need to support the staff in whatever way
they decide to organize on many important issues ranging from reform of the position evaluation system and greater staff
access to information and policy to changing grievance procedures and greater staff

Overcoming the
color barrier.
participation in decisions at the College,
we also need to ask ourselves where our
privilege as students at an elite, liberal arts
college comes in and why we don't interact more withpeople we see everyday and
are a part of our lives. It is difficult to try
to be supportive of the workers on a personal level. I know for myself that I have
had a hard time trying to forge with people
I see daily a kind of relationship that refutes the sense that we, students, are all
privileged, ungrateful kids. It is easier to
support staff on an institutional level but
most students here do not even do that.
A group of staff, students, and faculty
drafted a letter to members of the Staffing
Long Range Planning Committee expressing many concerns about how staff is valued and treated, concerns which, as students, we need to support whether by signing a letter and attending a meeting about
staff issues (as occurred twice in January
and February) or rallying support from
other students for effective and positive
change. Having attended the meeting
which occured on February 13thand which
was overflowing with members of the staff,

it was glaring to me that not only did all
members of the Committee which was supposed to address staff concerns seem to be
white but the overwhelming number of
employees who were in the audience
seemed to be as well. The absence of a
strong representation of employees ofcolor
concerned me very muchbecause it seemed
to me to be indicative of the complicated
labor situation at Swarthmore in which
workers are not organized into a union, students and others in the community do not
support the staff in substantial ways, workers cannot get organized because of the difficulty in uniting the many different divisions of staff, students are perceived in certain ways by staff and staff is perceived in
certain ways by students, and workers
themselves have many differences, some of
which lie beneath the surface and hinge
upon race.
Why don't we move to support staff?
Why does staffrepresentation seem so onesided? Not only are people unwilling to
help workers (the most visible of whom are
African American) but some people do not
seem to be invited into (or at least comfortable enough to be participating in) the discussion about labor practices; I see both
failings to be connected with race. The
topic of race is inexhaustible especially as
it relates to so many other issues in American society yet we continue to talk superficially about it or throw up our hands in defeat and say that we talk about it too much
and need to move "beyond" it. We cannot
move "beyond" anything if race is the undercurrent beneath so much in this country. I don'tknow how to talk about race in
real, honest ways but I believe that it won't
occur if we fool ourselves into thinking it
is absent in nearly everything that happens
and in the dynamics of so many situations.
Race is often tied to labor as it is on this
campus. A person I was talking to about
how to combat staff invisibility said "We
students have got to stop thinking about
staff as workers and start thinking about
them as people who work here." I think
that distinction is an important one to recognize but would also add that we need to
start thinking about the dynamics of the
workplace (in this case, Swarthmore College) and stop hoping to think about workers as people only, as people without color
because society is not color-blind and it is
unfair to dismiss the importance of race in
the understanding of inequality in the workplace.

never issues in my life. As a rank-and-file
worker in New Orleans, I became deeply
concerned about the socioeconomic barriers faced by low-income people. Yet I simply cannot relate with people who make
blanket statements about the evils ofbusiness and capitalism. Before I could even
describe anything in economics, I realized
that workers, business, and society would
all be better off if structures were in place
to help people like me in dead-end rankin-file jobs acquire more skills and move
up the socioeconomic ladder. Call it
Stafford Loans.
I especially value my economics major.
Not only is it a highly marketable major
but I gained especially strong qualitative
and quantitative analytical skills which are
transferable across disciplines and extremely relevant in business and public
policy. My transcript testifies to plenty of
academic blunders which hurt at the time
but five years from now who will remember? Who cares? What you get at Swarthmore is intellectual confidence. Even if you
don'tknow shit about something, you have
the capacity and stamina to say five pages
about it. In some places that would earn
you expert credentials.
I believe that a lot of Swarthmore students shortchange themselves in their employment opportunities. Regardless of your
major the liberal arts education cultivates
and nurtures core analytical skills. In the
average workplace the intellectual and interpersonal skills ofSwarthmore grads will
stand out. A lot of young graduates in the
workplace will tell you that they encountered a lot of people earning good money
that have never thought about doing anything differently, bitch about the smallest
hurdle, and lack any sort of creativity and
innovation. Beyond Swarthmore a great
deal of your future success will be determined by how well you package yourself
and communicate with target audiences.
In the long-run the prestige and US News
rankings don't mean shit. The Swarthmore
education is a tool

sion to keep her baby while continuing her
Swarthmore education. She revealed that the
experience was not overwhelming, as she had
a secure support system already in place: "I
had a husband to watch the baby at night when
I had seminar and a mother-in-law who came
for six weeks during finals so I could study."
She related instances of bringing her daughter
to classes, the positive response from professors who sent baby-gifts, and the grounded
sense of perspective she gained from parenting.
Schuchardt managed to keep her grades at prebaby level and graduated in four years.
Next to address the audience was Kotarski, a
nurse practitioner at Worth who deals specifically with women's reproductive health issues.
Kotarski explained some of the services available at Worth when a pregnancy is suspected
or has been confirmed. A free, confidential
pregnancy test is available, the results of which
are available in three minutes. Free, confidential counseling is also available at the Health
Center. Pennsylvania law requires health workers to provide patients with information about
adoption, abortion, and keeping the child, and
Kotarski explained that after the counseling,
"We [at Swarthmore] have the philosophy that
we are supporting the student in their decision
[whatever that decision may be]."
Dr. Ramirez used his time to describe the Psychological Services program at Swarthmore
and explain its role in helping a student affected
by pregnancy. Psych Services, located in the
North Wing ofWorth Health Center, offers free,
confidential counseling which is available as
long as the student remains at Swarthmore.
Ramirez spoke of three phases of counseling:
pre-pregnancy counseling which pertains to
anyone having unprotected sex, pregnancy
counseling during which options are explored,
and post-pregnancy counseling which involves
"dealing with new realities and limitations" and
working on re-conceptualizing one's idea of
independence.
Director of Residential Life and Assistant
Dean of the College Myrt Westphal outlined
Swarthmore's housing policy, focusing on how
pregnant or parenting students would be accommodated.

Presently, the College has no married or family housing and children are barred from residence halls overnight, due to health and safety
reasons. Westphal iterated that Swarthmore
would accommodate students by waiving the
first year on-campus residency requirement if
it adversely affected pregnant or parenting students. She also explained that students on full
scholarships wouldreceive thefunds that would
be used for on-campus housing for alternative
housing. "Swarthmore has a way of solving
problems," Westphal emphasized. "We would
look at each case individually and see what
works. The College, if it sees a need, is always
going to work to meet that need."
Dean Tedd Goundie confirmed that Swarthmore treats each case individually to determine
the best way of dealing with a pregnant or
parenting student. In dealing with questions of
academic requirements and related issues, special cases are considered, Goundie explained.
One service the College extends to students on
occasion is offering no-interest loans that must
be paid back before graduation. Some of these
loans have, however, been forgiven.
As Associate Dean ofStudent Life, Goundie
says he knows of no Swarthmore students who
are presently pregnant or parenting. He remembers three students in the last nine years who
had children and remained at Swarthmore to

finish their degree and a handful of others
who left Swarthmore and returned later.
Aarti Iyer '99, co-Coordinator of the ProChoice Task Force explained the goals behind the joint panel by stating, "Our tendency is to assume that unwanted pregnancies either don't happen at Swarthmore or
get taken care of in a pretty predictable way.
Our goal was to explore the history of this
issue on campus and to find out what policies Swarthmore has and whether these policies would support a woman's decision,
whatever that decision would be."
Iyer explained that both SSAL and the
PCTF had been interested in doing a project
together, so when SSAL approached PCTF
about the panel idea, the task force saw it is
an issue where both groups could find common ground. In discussing the groups' decision to work jointly, Schwendiman explained, "If the College is taking a prochoice standpoint I want to do everything I
can to make sure all the options are there,
and I know that's what the pro-choice group
wants, too."
Iyer adds that the project could be carried
out with the support of only one of the
groups, "but not on a campus like
Swarthmore's where ideological diversity
and seeing all sides ofissues are valued."

nication to people about what's going 0n... [People] need to [use] the
committee as a process to arrive at
consensus [and] get people's input."
The ad hoc committee is also concerned with the perpetuation of the
College's hierarchical structure.
"When I came [to Swarthmore], the
first thing that I realized was that this
was like an upstairs-downstairs," explains Kalwaic. "There's one tier in
the upstairs, and another whole tier
down here... We have to be aware of
the stratificationand really work hard
to do everything we can to eliminate
that upstairs-downstairs feeling."
"[People at Swarthmore] don't
think they're affected by the class
system," she continues, "or they think
that the class system is something
that's out there, not right here. I think
the first thing is people have to realize how much it's a part of how we
do things here at the College, and
until we recognize it we really can't
change it."
Amy Dalton '9B, a member of the
SLRPC and the Student Labor Action Group (SLAG) says that while
there have been unavoidable logistical dilemmas, "I have enjoyed work-

scheduled in commemoration of
Israel 50 Week. The purpose of
the week is to acknowledge and
celebrate through the presence of
guest speakers, lectures, and cultural activities, the 50th anniversary of the state ofIsrael.
While Jewish communities all
over the world will actively parthis

Swarthmore's own Jewish community along with Jewish groups
from about 30 other colleges and
universities in the Philadelphia
region, are sponsoring activities
this week designed to promote a
sense of culture, awareness, and
appreciation for the diversity that

is associated with Judaism and
Jewishness.
According to Swarthmore College Jewish Advisor Rebecca
France, "the Jewish experience is
not unilateral
the activities
planned for Israel 50 week reflect
that."
The first event on March 29th
from 2 to 4 p.m. is an Israeli Shuk
or market on Magill Walk. The
Shuk will feature ethnic food, arts
and crafts, Israeli dancing, and information about travel and work
opportunities in Israel.

Thank you,
Sharpies
Dear Students,
Due to the rash of laptop computer thefts in
McCabe recently, Public Safety has forgone
sleep and doughnuts to compile this list of tips
on protecting your laptop. Study it well:

;

1. Don't leave your lap top computer alone on
a desk for 6 hours while you are "resting your
eyes" on one of the couches in the lounges
2. Trade in your lap top for one of those computers they used back in the 1960s that were
larger than most small European countries
(we're envisioning Albania here) but still
couldn't reliably calculate the square root of
four. You can bet that even the most adept burglar couldn't sneak one of those babies out of
McCabe.
3. Solder your lap top to the flank of a horse.
We believe that this precaution could cut down
thefts more than 50%, for the diligent people
sitting at the front desk of the library would probably be more apt to notice a burglar walking out
of McCabe with a herd of horses in tow than
merely an armful of computers. But remember,
don't forget to feed the horse. There's nothing
more annoying than having to drag around a
dead horse with you all day, even if it is really

Ivy
Apartment Life
Atlantic Records
Ivy's new album, Apartment Life, is all about
ultralight indie pop. It's not music to complement
any kind of emotional state, it's just real groovy and
dispassionate. The singer, a Ms. Dominique Durand,
makes the band what it is. She has a Nico-like Germanic accent going that really works for her. I don't
know whether she's trying to do it or if she really is
an auslander, but either way, the accent, together with
her clear, ringing vocal quality, lends a cool, withdrawn feel to the whole effort. The lyrics themselves
aren't really remarkable; I can'trecall a single standout phrase. Mostly, the vocals are immersed in the
rest of the music, an integral part of the work, but not
intended for consideration apart from the rest. Never
intense, always detached, Durand's voice forms an
otherworldly base for the musical landscape.
Thepoppy, ethereal music behind the vocals is generally well done. There's some wonderful, hooky
guitarwork on this album, kind of like that found in a
lot ofotherVelvet Underground-derivative bands, but
here it's usually punctuated with a driving, insistent
beat. The music is so saturated with guitar noise,
drums, and sometimes trumpets and strings, that it
often recalls trance or ambient work during the instrumental portions. The atmospheric pop noise fits
well with Durand's floating vocals. The album, in
general, offers a very appealing group of airy pop
songs, as long as you don't mind that they have no
earthy foundations.

The Liquor Giants
Every Other Day at a Time
Matador Records
The Liquor Giants are continuing the guitar-driven
pop tradition of Paul Westerberg, Teenage Fanclub,
and Alex Chilton pretty successfully. Every song on
their new album, Every Other Day at a Time, is ridden with rockin', testosterone-laden hooks, and lyrics filled chiefly with either self-pity or pity for the
opposite sex. The music is generally well-executed
and fairly well-produced, but there's a sharp contrast
between the real pop gems on the album and theother
songs that just seem to fill the space between the high
points. These songs are sometimes disappointing,
but when the Liquor Giants are good, they're really
very good. "Kentucky Lounge," "It's Raining Butterflies," and "Caroline" are especially appealing
tracks, and the first of these is just terrific. The Giants mix Beatlesque harmonies with a sense of
strained cheer as they pay homage to a broke and
broken, beer smelling bar hog. The other two songs
are just real good love songs, open and honest as "I
Wanna Hold Your Hand."
In general, the Liquor Giants do well as long as
they stick to conventional song topics, like love and
alcohol, and don't try too hard to get meta. They
tend otherwise to wax a little too poetic, straying on
the side of nonsense
not funny, quirky nonsense,
but "what the hell are they talking about?" nonsense.
This band's talent is making the mundane into something extraordinary, and when they try to do it, they
do it extraordinarily well.

Pure
Feverish
Mammoth Records
Sometimes there are bands that have a distinctive
sound, and sometimes there are bands that sample the
distinctive sounds from a lot of other bands. Pure's
new album is a sampler. Starting off with a couple
kiss-off rockers ala Beck and Sonic Youth, they proceed into Bill Janovitz and Wilco country with alternatively raucous and introspective countrified rock.
Add a couple Yo La Tengo-esque anthems, mix it all
about, and you get their album. I usually have a problem with this sort ofmiscellaneous artist, but Pure pulls
the whole thing off pretty well. There's no hint here
that they are extending themselves beyond their areas
of musical expertise; they're equally capable at just
about everything they do. The variety, instead of
stretching them thin, lends a lot ofinterest to the work
as a whole.
There is a certain continuity throughout the whole
work, and that's the feeling of seriousness and professionalism that lies under everything they do, even when
they're rocking out with the twang and the distortion
on maximum. It's like all their work here is an academic study of the style they're miming, and they're
looking at it from the distance of an art historian. This
doesn't mean the work is dry. It just means that it
seems like there's some extra thought going into it,
beyond that usually expected of a more unified, more
gut-guided band. Iggy Pop didn't think too muchabout
punk he just invented it. It's up to bands like Pure
to take the newly invented and develop it.

Live Music, Good Food at Trendy Warmdaddy's
by Rachel Adams
When a few friends and I headed off to
Warmdaddy's last Friday, we went out for
an evening of live music, a change of atmosphere and the opportunity to get
dressed up for something other than
movie night in Martin. The southern cuisine of Warmdaddy's and the highly entertaining performance of Bobby Rush
were unexpected surprises. Of all the
places to hear jazz and blues as listed in
the Philadelphia paper, Warmdaddy's is
one of the few that is open to people under twenty-one. As the recording will tell
you, dress is 'fashionably casual,' but no
tank-tops, sportswear or sneakers, thank
you kindly.
After paying the ten dollars, cover
charge (there's a music fee after 8 p.m.
that varies according to the performer),
we entered into a restaurant that was complete with a dining area, a bar and a stage.
While somewhat smoky, the room is
dimly lit and quite pleasant with colorful
paintings all around and an aura of ex-

citement. The crowd was mixed with
people of all ages. The maitre'd sat us
conspicuously under the stage, practically at the feet of Bobby Rush as he performed, because we were young goodlooking hipsters...or so we'd like to think.
The other hypothesis was that perhaps
they were just marking us for being under age (but we are young hipsters, even
if we do go to Swarthmore!). None of us
attempted to order alcohol after our waitress came over and offered to get us "Virgin Daiquiris, Virgin Shirley Temples, or
perhaps a Cherry Vanilla Soda?"
Since we'd all eaten dinner, we only
ordered light fare and drinks
sides of
mashed potatoes, candied yams and salads...okay, I got the cherry vanilla soda
and I liked it. Although we didn't try any
entrees, I've heard that it's a good idea
to be adventurous with the menu there
because you'll probably enjoy whatever
you order, even if the food seems foreign
to you.
There were only two sets on the night
we visited, contrary to the answering

machine message which reported three
sets on Friday and Saturday nights at
9:00, 10:30 and midnight. Warmdaddy's
also has live blues six nights a week; on
Tuesday through Thursday, sets are at
8:30,10:00 and 11:30. We had arrived at
10:30 for the second set, but it wasn't till
11:30 that the set actually started.
Bobby's back-up band came out first and
warmed up the crowd. They were pretty
good and I think we were all jiving with
the music, happy to be off-campus, enjoying the atmosphere...when the man
himself emerged.
Bobby Rush stood before us in all his
glory. For a few moments, he stood tapping his foot and looking...well...snazzy?
Bobby wore a shiny (albeit a bit frayed)
metallic shirt, shiny metallic shoes, a
rhinestone studded belt and it would be a
travesty not to mention his shiny, curly,
black hair that dangled just belowhis ears
heavy with hair grease. Bobby mentioned
something about liking his women fat to
introduce his two back-up dancers, who
strutted out, all attitude, wearing tight red

body suits, fishnet stockings and high
heels. Throughout the performance, the
women would periodically return backstage only to re-emerge wearing new ensembles.
Those easily offended, be wary as you
read on
Bobby was a bit lewd. In one
memorable number, the dancers shook
theirbutts at the audience for several minutes on end as Bobby stood with his ear
close to the butts and talked/sang about
how the butts were speaking to him. Then
he offered to make the butts sing to us for
five dollars. When the audience finally
came through with the money, he placed
the microphone up to the gyrating
mounds of cellulite, and commanded
"sing," at which point a burst of music
exploded from the band behind. Equally
amusing as Bobby Rush, himself, were
the rather astounded, shell-shocked looking faces of my companions.
Undoubtedly, Bobby Rush was in a
league of his own and Warmdaddy's told

Chan Strikes
Again with
Mr. Nice Guy
If you're like
me, and you're

faced with the
choice between
an Oscar-nominated critic's
darling and a
Altered States cheap Jackie
Patrick Runkle
Chan chop socky
movie imported
to America, you will invariably choose the
latter. Let's face it: Everybody loves
Jackie, and he's here to stay.
Mr. Nice Guy follows faithfully in the notso-well-respected footsteps of 1996's
Rumble In The Bronx and 1997's First
Strike. Generic Hong Kong movies are
instantly identifiableand virtually indistinguishable from each other. Jackie bumbles
about, gets involved with some bad guys,
fights in Rube-Goldberg style fight scenes,
and then commandeers some large vehicle
for the climax. It's a tried-and-true formula, and it works.
In Mr. Nice Guy, Jackie Chan plays
Jackie, an Australian TV chef who spends
most ofhis day buying groceries and making stir-frys, it would seem. One day,
Jackie accidentally gets a videotape that
exposes Giancarlo (Richard Norton), one
of Australia's biggest drug lords. Of
course, legions of tough guys are dispatched to track down Jackie and get the
tape. Complications ensue only for the
purpose, it seems, of extending Mr. Nice
Guy into a feature-length motion picture.
Criticism fails in the face of movies like
Mr. Nice Guy. I was bored sometimes, I
was excited sometimes, and sometimes I
was genuinely amused. For every interesting stunt or cool piece of camerawork,
there's a bad sight gag or lame bit of dialogue. Indeed, these movies are so set in
their formulas that I would be shocked to
see one that's truly different. I think that
by now everyone knows what they are getting into when they go to see Jackie Chan
in anything.
Mr. Nice Guy was directed by Sammo
Hung, who also has a humorous extended
cameo as an injured bicyclist in the movie.
Hung is an old pro Hong Kong filmmaker/
stuntman, and he makes sure all the action
goes off without a hitch. The movie was
re-edited for American release by veteran
action editor Michael Duthie, who cut out
lots ofunnecessary expository material that
would have just bored the audience anyway.
Sadly, the entire dubbed Jackie Chan
genre may be coming to an end. The one
distinguishing characteristic of Mr. Nice
Guy is that almost the entire movie is in
English. It was made after Rumble In The
Bronx had come out in America, and the
attempt seems to be to make it appeal to a
larger English-speaking audience. On top
of that, Jackie Chan has made a deal to star
in his first fully-American movie, Rush
Hour, to be directed by BrettAfo/iey
7a/)bßatner. So, Mr. Nice Guy may be one
of the last chances you get to soak up some
mindless chop socky in the theater. Don't
miss it.

My friends and I had a Warmdaddy's
experience that we certainly won't forget
anytime soon. For days since we've been
singing such catchy tunes as "Your love, is

with that —too short..too littlc.too limp,"
complete with dance moves too! If you
ask Chris Woodrell nicely, he might even
be willing to perform the dance that goes
along with it, although, unfortunately...no,
perhaps fortunately...without the tight red
body suit.

A Cappella Weekend Rocks Swat Campus
by Jennifer Callaghan
This past weekend, the Swarthmore campus played host to a musical whirlwind of
collegiate a cappella. Joining our own Sixteen Feet and Grapevine groups, ensembles
from both coasts of the country performed
with programs (not to mention costumes)
that were as diverse as their breeding
grounds, singing renditions of everything
from Indigo Girls and Harry Connick Jr.
to Crash Test Dummies and No Doubt.
On Saturday night, the Sixteen Feet
kicked off the weekend in Lang Concert
Hall with the Toe Jam, featuring Stanford
University's Fleet Street Singers and Harmonics and Brown University's Brown
Derbies. The Sixteen Feet began with two
songs of their own, ÜB4o's "Red, Red
Wine" and James Taylor's "Carolina",
characteristically barefoot and exuberant.
The stage was then handed over to the Fleet
Street Singers, another men's group, which
sang old favorites like Kenny Loggins'
"House at Pooh Corner" and School House
Rock, which showcased some exciting
counting skills and an almost operatic
"Conjunction Junction."Their performance
ended with a crowd-pleasing Haverford
insult that was inserted into theirlast song.
The Harmonics were next, a mixed group
which sang modern tunes such as Matchbox 20's "Push", No Doubt's "Just a Girl",
and "Criminal" by Fiona Apple, which
were delivered with great emotion.Last up
were America's best a cappella group, the
Brown Derbies. Their set, which included
Indigo Girls "Romeo and Juliet", REM's
"Downeaster Alexis" and the Rocky theme
"Eye of the Tiger," was periodically

complimented by skits taken from "Rocky"
and "The Dating Game" and they were
by far the most genteel flirts of the evening.
Grapevine organized the next event, hosting Oberlin's Obertones and the Carleton
Knights early Sunday evening in
Mephistos. The Swarthmore women's
groupbegan the program, singing hits such
as Bonnie Rait's "Have a Heart", the
Beatles "Yesterday", and the ever popular
Swat-specific "Small School After All."
They then gave the floor to the Obertones,
a men's group in stylish tie-dyed t-shirts,
and joined the audience.
They introduced themselves with a spinoff of the Chipmunk's theme song and
managed to work in "Little Red Riding
Hood." Their five-minute version of the
Karate Kid, judging from this year's Academy award winner, would have rivaled any
of 1997's Hollywood films. Grapevine's
well-known compassion provided free
pizza for the audience after the Obertones
left the stage, and the Carleton Knights began their performance shortly afterwards
to a well-fed crowd. The Knights sang a
variety of numbers, including Harry
Connick Jr.'s "Heavenly" and the Crash
Test Dummies "God Shuffled his Feet" as
well as "My Jerusalem" by Sting. Their
percussion section was especially impressive, producing constant laughter and applause from the audience.
The a cappella weekend was a musical
success, as the various groups packed both
LPAC and Mephistos and earned plentiful
applause. Much thanks to both the Sixteen
Feet and Grapevine for their efforts in organizing an impressive and thoroughly
enjoyable exhibition of a cappella talent.

Fun was had by all at A Cappella weekend.

The men's lacrosse team improved its record to 2-4 on the season following a 4-3 triumph over
Wooster last Saturday. Goalie Sig
Rydquist 'OO stopped 13 shots to
lead the Tide, who have thus far
shown remarkable improvement
from last year's winless squad.
Playing in a freezing downpour
that had resulted in other games on
campus being cancelled, the Garnet were thirsting for revenge after
last year's discouraging loss to the
Scots. The revenge factor played a
huge part in the mentality of the
Garnet. "As a team, going into the
game, we were very focused on
what we had to do to win" said senior co-captain Aaron Hultgren.
Spotting Wooster an early goal,
Swarthmore came right back as
freshman Mark Dingfield drew a
double-team and found Toby
Patterson 'OO, who rifled the ball
into the cage to knot the game at
one. But Wooster fought back and
took a 2-1 lead. From there on, the
defense played outstandingly, holding the Scots to just one goal over
the next 50 minutes.
At the beginning of the second
quarter, senior attackman Steve
Shin beat his man and found the
back of the net to once again tie the
game. Just a minute later, Dingfield
scored a goal of his own on an error by the Wooster goalie. As the
goalie, who had come out of the

cage, took his stick back to pass the
ball, the ball rolled outto Dingfield
who promptly took advantage of
the open net for the 3-2 lead.
Determined not to lose the game,
Swat dominatedthe rest of the second and third quarters. The Tide
out-shot their opponents 34-19,
picked up three times more ground
balls, and, most importantly, remained out of the penalty box.
After Shin scoredhis second goal
of the game in a man-up situation,
Wooster began to pressure Swarthmore and to close the difference.
A goal with 5:1 remaining by the
Scots made it close, but Rydquist,
who earned a spot on the Conference Honor Roll, made three saves
in the closing moments to preserve
the win.
"Sig has come along and turned
himself into a great goalie," said
coach Pat Gress. "He has really
come up big in games when we
needed him." Rydquist was quick
to give credit to his defense, consisting of underclassmen Tucker

Zengerle 'OO, Charles Fischette
'Ol, and Ford O'Connell 'OO, and
seniors Erik Johnson, Alex
DeShields, Matt Halpern, and
Hultgren. Dingfield and Mike
Lloyd 'Ol remain near the top of
the conference scoring list with
17 and 15 points, respectively.
Swat's next game is tomorrow at
Scranton where they will overcome the 10-5 loss to Scranton
in 1996.

SPORTS

Baseball Commits Costly
Errors, Loses to Widener
by Patricia Barrientos
In the hopes of rebounding from last
week's loss to Lebanon Valley, the Garnet
baseball team jumped out to an early lead
against Widener University. Centerfielder
Joe Aleffi 'OO singled to start the game and
promptly stole second base. Three batters
later, Allefi crossed home plate courtesy of
Carlo Fitti's 'OO timely three-run homer.
The solid third baseman went deep giving
pitcher Josh Roth '99 a three run lead before he even set foot on the mound.
However, Widener came back to tie the game
in their half of the inning. The Garnet scored
two more runs, but it was not enough to lift
them over Widener, who went on to win 17-5.
The Garnet temporarily regained the lead in
the top of the second inning when catcher Josh
Lindsey 'Ol led off the inning with a single
and came around to score on a double by Aleffi.
Nonetheless, Widener blew the game open in
the third inning when they scored 7 runs, all of
them unearned.

Although the team only committed two errors, they were very costly as both ignited a
flow ofWidener runs in the third and sixth innings.
Starter Roth pitched six innings, giving up
14 runs but only five earned on 14 hits. He
struck out five and walked six. Jay Schembs
'Ol replaced Roth in the seventh. He went two
innings, allowing three hits and one earnedrun.
Aleffi finished with three hits and one RBI.
Clayton Cohn 'Ol, who started in left field and
second baseman Dan Johnston '9B each

singled.
As the team awaits Thursday's home game
against Richard Stockton, the Garnet look beyond the Widener loss and try to focus on the
winning formula. As one player put it, "we
have to make the plays, hit the ball, nothing
fancy." With the conference games just a few
days away, every game is becoming increasing important. "It was a bad game," said Cohn,
"but there will be another game and another
game after that. We just have to go out there
ready to win every game."

Women's Lax Racks Up
Another Win, Record 2-0
by Natania Kremcr
The Swarthmore women's
lacrosse team record is now
2-0 with a win Tuesday
against Washington College.
Swarthmore travelled to

Washington to play at
Shriver Field. The journey
did not set them back at all.
The Garnet and racked up
ten goals in the first twenty
minutes. Holly Baker '99
set the tone for the attack,
scoring the first two goals
and contributing a total of
six goals and two assists
throughout the game. Betsy
Rosenbaum '9B added another four goals and two assists. Alicia Googins 'OO
nailed in another four goals
while Erika Williams 'Ol
helped the Garnet with two
more. At the end of the first
half, Swarthmore led 11-1.
The strong lead gave the
Garnet an opportunity to try
out some offensive plays and
to get accustomed to working together. Williams commented that "the first half
was definitely the best we've

played so far this season."
The defense also did a
great job, holding offWashington until the last two

Washington "had nothing on

and that "during the Washington game, we really saw
what we're capable of."
Swat dominated also by
hustling to pick up 44
ground balls, compared to
Washington's 24, allowing
the Garnet to maintain possession and clinch the game
with a final score of 16-5.
Assistant Coach Lisa Rubin
characterized the Washington game as a "strong first
conference win due to tremendous efforts by both the
offense and defense."
Cathy Morris 'OO felt "the
'reason that the game was so
good was that the team
maintained intensity the
time."
The
whole
Swarthmore women's lacrosse team has started off
the season with a lot of drive
and continues to gain momentum as they prepare to
travel to Vassar College this
coming weekend for the
Seven Sisters tournament.
Their next home game is
against Dickinson College at
1 p.m. on Saturday, April 4.

Bad weather and poor field conditions forced the
Garnet to postpone their match against Cabrini and
a doubleheader against Drew University until later
in April. Swat's only action this week came eight
days after their last game. The Garnet dropped
both games in their conference opener to the
Shorewomen from Washington College, 3-1 and
7-5.
In the first game, the Garnet were unable to come
up with the offense needed to support their solid
defense. "Dana Lehman '9B did a great job out
there on the mound, we just didn't get our bats
working fast enough," commented Kate Fama'ol.
Rightfielder Amy White 'OO went 2 for 3, and
Michelle Walsh '9B had a double. Heather
Marandola 'Ol scored the lone run.
Although they struck in the first inning by taking an early lead, the Garnet were unable to hold
onto it, as Washington pushed runs across the plate
steadily. "We came back pretty strong, but those
early innings just really hurt us," said Fama. Swat
suffered a number of key mental errors, in addition to fielding and throwing errors, which may
have cost them the game. The team rallied in the
last few innings and narrowed the margin, but it
was too late in the game for the damage to be overcome. Walsh led the team from the plate, going 3
for 4 with two doubles.
"I don't know if we have that killing spirit yet,
but I'd say we're getting there. We definitely work
well together as far as talking to each other out
there and cheering each other on," noted Fama.
The team will look to regroup before they take on
the Bullets from Gettysburg, Saturday at 1 p.m.
The Garnet play host to non-conference foe Beaver College Tuesday at 4 p.m.
