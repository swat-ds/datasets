Corrections
In last week's issue, the article entitled, "Antibodies: Nature's

inaccurately described the nature of the research, which does
not deal with antibodies. Melinda Yang 'lO is not enrolled in Prof.
Sara Hiebert Burch's biology seminar, but in a different seminar
with which the researchers are collaborating. The research aims
to address two distinct hypotheses which were not sufficiently
differentiated in the article: the first one deals with genetics and
immunity and the second is concerned with hormones. In the
experiment, it would be possible for an individual to exhibit
'attractive" genes while simultaneously exhibiting "unattractive"
levels of hormones.
In last week's article entitled, "Flyers frame dialogue, pose
questions of identity," the quote beginning, "The Swarthmore
College Republicans takes great offense ..." should have been
attributed to Justin Shaffer 'OB.
Due to an editorial error, Julian Chender's most recent column

Conference on deaf culture attracts diverse audience
BY HANNAH PURKEY
hpurkeyl@swarthmore.edu
Last Friday and Saturday, the linguistics department, in
with the William J. Cooper Foundation, hosted
a conference at Swarthmore on deaf culture and issues. The
conjunction

conference, entitled "Around the Deaf World in Two Days
(It's a Small World)," focused on a variety of topics concerning sign language, social issues and creativity in deaf communities around the world.

"I'm a linguist, and what defines deaf culture more than
anything is language, so it is natural for us to want to study
it," professor of linguistics Donna Jo Napoli said.
The conference opened Friday night with a welcome from
Vice President Maurice Eldridge '6l, followed by a lecture by
Carol Padden, professor of linguistics at University of
California San Diego, entitled "Sign Language Geography:
Creation and Spread of Sign Language Around the World."
In the lecture, Padden spoke on the state of sign languages in
different areas of the world, focusing on countries in the
Middle East. Padden analyzed, among other things, select
sign languages from Jordan to point out similarities
between them and American Sign Language.
"In Middle Eastern Countries it is very feasible and very
possible to drive three hours and find a completely different
sign language, because they live in dangerous places and
dangerous times," Padden said in her lecture. "But I don't
think this would be the case if we were in Paris." In her talk,
Padden indicated that the 'danger" she referred to was a
function of both what she believed to be limitations in the
ability to traverse the geography of the Middle East, and also
of political instability in certain parts of the region. With
limited ability for visual contact between deaf communities,
many unique sign language communities have developed.
The conference continued all day Saturday, offering lectures and panels on not only the linguistics of sign language,
but also on social issues with regard to the deaf community.
Saturday also featured a creative performance by students
from the Pennsylvania School for the Deaf, as well as a lecture on and performance of British sign language poetry.
The presentation included a talk by Rachel Sutton-Spence of
the Centre for Deaf Studies at the University of Bristol, U.K.,
on what deaf poetry is and how it can be best enjoyed. The
talk was followed by a demonstration by Paul Scott, one of
Britain's foremost British sign language poets. Both hearing
and deafattendees enjoyed the performance. "I came as part
of a class and because we did a lot of work to set up the conference, but I probably would have come anyways since I am
really interested in sign language," linguistics major
Katherine Hagan 'O9 said. "It was a really beautiful conference, a beautiful celebration of the deaf community."

Elisa Lopez Phoenix Staff

Both hearing and deaf students took advantage of the events held at the conference last weekend.

Attendees came from all over the world to attend the con-

ference, according to Napoli. "This was a true international
conference; we had people from all over," Napoli said. "We

had people from Mongolia and Kenya and China and people
from within the United States
people came from everywhere. It was wonderful." Napoli attributes some of the conference's international draw to the fact that it is the first con-

ference of its type. According to Napoli, while there have

been many other conferences on specific topics affecting the
deaf community, there has never been a major conference
looking at the entire situation of deaf communities around
the world with respect to all aspects of life. "It got activists
and scholars talking about things together," Napoli said. "It
was very holistic in a way that most conferences are not."
The conference was made possible by the sponsorship of
the William J. Cooper Foundation, a foundation set up to
bring in a variety of lectures, performances and exhibitions
that enrich the academic work of Swarthmore.
"The interesting thing about the Foundation, the thing I
am so grateful for, is that anything funded by William J.
Cooper must be free and open to the public," Napoli said.

"And it is only free things that most deafpeople can come to,
and for an international conference like this, most people
are going to have a very high price tag already."
Because of language constraints and the dearth ofeducational opportunities for deafpeople, Napoli said that the deaf
face especially high expenses. "As a result if you don't have
a free conference, you exclude a lot of people who would
have wanted to come," Napoli said. The college offered to

find housing for anyone who needed it for the conference.
These efforts by Napoli and the linguistics department
helped the conference to effectively represent the interna-

tional deafcommunity. "Being immersed in the deaf culture,
in an environment where signing is the norm, was a real culture shock," conference attendee Joel Lemuel said. Lemuel
indicated that he attended the conference more for the cultural aspect of the deaf community than the linguistic structures of sign language. "It was really fascinating, and I actually was jealous. Whenever someone laughed, I wanted to
know what they were laughing about. It made me hungry to
learn more. I think I'm going to go open a Signing for
Dummies book."

Expansion of gender-neutral housing proposed
BY ARIEL MARTINO

amartinl@swarthmore. edu
The Housing Committee has formulated
a proposal for the creation of gender-neutral
halls in the basement ofWillets Hall and the
first floor of David Kemp Hall starting next
fall. The proposal was presented to Myrt
Westphal, the associate dean for student life,
who was optimistic about the expansion of
options for gender-neutral housing.

Liz Derickson 'Ol, housing coordinator

and member of the Housing Committee,
cited the shortage of gender-neutral housing

options available to sophomores as a reason

behind the change. "[The housing lottery]
offers a degree of autonomy to upperclass-

men, but sophomores are often limited in
their choices," Derickson said.
Currently, there are several gender-neutral halls with gender-neutral bathrooms
located off-campus in Mary Lyon, Palmer,
Pittenger, Roberts, Strath Haven and
Woolman. On campus, however, the options
are more limited: Worth, the Lodges and
Wharton CD all have gender-neutral housing with full-service bathrooms, while the
second floor of both Dana and Hallowell

THE PHOENIX

have gender-neutral rooms but not bathrooms. According to Dominic Lowell 'OB, a
member of the housing committee and RA

in Worth, this accounts for only about 20
percent of the housing on campus. "Further,
dorms like Wharton CD and Worth, the bulk
of gender-neutral housing on campus are
unavailable to sophomores, the group seen
as wanting gender-neutral housing options
the most," Lowell said.
Comparatively, according to Derickson,
Haverford has gender-neutral housing as an
option in the vast majority of its dorms.
Adding gender-neutral halls in Willets
and David Kemp will provide another
option for sophomores who may not have a
high enough lottery number to live in
Wharton or Worth and who do not want to
live off-campus. Nearly a third of the sophomore class lives in Willets, making it an
obvious candidate for offering a gender-neutral housing option.
The Housing Committee believes that
David Kemp is also a good location for additional on-campus gender-neutral housing.
The floor plan of David Kemp includes a
breezeway, dividing the first floor, with a
bathroom on each side. This may cause

inconvenience for males who may have to
cross the breezeway to use a gendered bath-

room on the other side and vice versa.
Derickson called this a "prime location for
gender-neutral [housing]" because of the
lack of gender-neutral halls in both Alice
Paul and Mertz. Also, according to the housing committee proposal, David Kemp Hall's

compliance with the American Disabilities
Act was a huge draw in order to provide
facilities that are both handicap accessible
and gender-neutral.
However, some students are uncomfortable with the prospect of introducing gender-neutral housing. Even if students living
on a gender-neutral hall have a roommate of
the same gender, in Willets and David Kemp
they may have to share a bathroom with
members of the opposite gender.
Cleanliness is the foremost issue for most
females, as many women say that men have
very different standards of cleanliness.
Willets resident Sylvia Boateng 11 worried
about exposure, pointing out the fact that
there are only flimsy shower curtains, not
actual doors on the showers, adding that

there are "barely doors on the bathroom."
Other students share concerns of expo-

sure. "It's necessary to re-vamp the existing
bathrooms before you ask for a change,"
Willets resident Sable Mensah 'll said.
Zebi Brown 'O9, an RA in Willets, said
that while "some people may feel uncomfortable in so-called 'ungendered housing,'
others may not feel comfortable anywhere
else."

Derickson believes that the concerns
over the facilities should not stand in the
way of making the campus more inclusive.
"This college has made a commitment to not
discriminate against folks on the basis of
sexual identity," Derickson said. In the spirit of inclusiveness, the college recently
added gender identity to its Equal
Opportunity Clause. Last semester, McCabe
Library instated its first gender-neutral
bathroom in what was formerly a men's
room on the second floor. Many single bathrooms around campus, including one in
Parrish, are also gender-neutral.
It seems that many students are ready for
a shift to more ungendered bathrooms. The
housing form for the class of 2011 featured a
question about the gendering ofbathrooms.

SwatBBS added to dashboard WEEK IN PICTURES
phoenix.swarthmore.edu

BY MATT BLEIMAN
mbleimal@swarthmore.edu
Last week, a new link appeared on the
Student Dashboard to SwatßßS, a forum
designed by Ben Zhang 'lO to facilitate discussion among Swarthmore students in a
more organized manner than on other sites
such as the Daily Jolt.
Zhang said that bulletin board systems
similar to SwatßßS are very popular in
China, where he is from, and that they make
it very easy to reach out to people you don't
know. "You may find people as equally passionate as you," he said.

"This is an opportunity for
responsible and personal
dsicussion online at
Swarthmore."
Stephen Hoyer 'OB
As
of mid-afternoon Wednesday,
SwatßßS had 162 posts, 99 topics and 84 registered members.
According to Zhang, although The
Phoenix and The Daily Gazette are good
sources for the spread of information on
campus, SwatßßS provides a less formal
venue for the dissemination of news and
ideas. It is Zhang's hope that people who just
want to talk about a specific issue and write
a small paragraph here and there about
something they are interested in can use
SwatßßS as an alternative medium.
The site uses a PHP platform and is a
moderated forum. "I made it really easy to
do multimedia posting," Zhang said. "You
can post pictures, You Tube videos, links and
all kinds of stuff. I tried to make it really flexible and versatile."
The site is designed to be accessible

exclusively to members of the Swarthmore
community, Zhang said.
In response to suggestions from other
students, Zhang set up a registration system
with the help of Stephan Hoyer 'OB that
requires users to register with their
Swarthmore usernames. A new poster must
enter his or her email address as the user-

name and then the site sends an activation
code to that address.

"[SwatßßS] is not a big
thing right now, but I
expect students to get
interested."
Ben Zhang 'ID
Creator, SwatßßS
Hoyer said it was important to require
students to use their real names on the site,
distinguishing it from other online discussion forums that already exist, like the Daily
Jolt and comments on The Gazette.
"This is an opportunity for responsible
and
personal
discussion online at

Zhang believes that his site will be useful because it will reflect student interests. "I really want student input," he
said. "I put a lot of thought into categories
and I want to know ifpeople want more or

less."
SwatßßS is currently recruiting moderators, designers and others to help with
the site. Hoyer, who has been a programmer and administrator on another large
online forum, has helped with the project
but as a second-semester senior is also
busy planning for the future. "It would be
great if Ben could get some help from
other experienced PHP programmers and
those who have run online forums
before," he said.
In addition to administrators for the
forum, Zhang hopes to get other contributors to the site.
"It is a good medium to publish things
you can hear everything. I hope in the
future to add music from Swarthmore
musicians, hold literary contests with
professors helping with commentary and
other projects," he said.
Zhang drew a clear distinction, however, between SwatßßS and the Daily
Jolt. "The Daily Jolt forum has a very linstructurally it's really
ear structure
bad. Topics also tend to be vulgar and not
useful. People vent anger and discuss top-

ics anonymously," he said. "Also, the
Daily Jolt is a nationally syndicated site
so the makers are behind the scenes. On
the other hand, we want to adapt the BBS
to students. I really look into student
input." Swat BBS is also noncommercial
and non-profit.
Jon Peters 'O9, who helped with ideas
for the site, was very enthusiastic about
the project. "As I understand it, many
other colleges have similar message
boards that are specific to students,"
Peters said.
As of now, there has not been much

publicity for the site, though Zhang was
able to have a link to SwatßßS added to

the Student Dashboard.
According to ITS Manager of Web
Projects Kelly Mueller, the web team
decides what goes on the dashboard by
considering student priorities and needs
and tries to be flexible and transparent.
"The feedback we receive plays the
largest role in determining what to
include. We are inclined to add content
that gets requested multiple times if
there is a feasible way to do it," Mueller

said.

Mueller indicated that students in the
past have requested that the dashboard
link to forums similar to SwatßßS, and
that the web team wanted to give
SwatßßS a chance to see if it would
become an active student forum.
"For now, the SwatßßS is a temporary
presence on the dashboard. We wanted
to give the students working on the project a chance to build and establish the
service," she said. "Whether it stays on

the dashboard depends on whether students actually use it."
Other student forums, specifically the
Daily Jolt, are not on the dashboard due
to a lack of expressed interest to add
them. Mueller said that no one has ever
requested that it be added. In the case
that such a site was requested, a broader
decision making process wouldbe used to
see if it should be added.

Swarthmore, and it follows a successful
model from a number of similar schools,

to stimulate discussions relevant to their

Panel brings together students of U.S., China
phoenix.swarthmore.edu

BY ROSARIO PAZ

rpazl@swarthmore.edu
Last Friday afternoon, the college hosted "China Meets
the World: Olympics, Modernization and Beyond," two backto-back discussions titled "China, U.S. and the World" and
"China and Transformation." During the panels, eight student representatives from the college and seven Chinese students from two of China's leading universities, Peking and
Tsinghua University, discussed global issues concerning the
sociopolitical and cultural issues currently important for
China and U.S.-China relations.
According to Alice Xiang 10, one of the event's primary
organizers, the discussions were part of a series of debates in
the 2008 LENOVO-IMUSE tour in which visiting Chinese

students were given the opportunity to tour several
American colleges and universities, including Yale and
Georgetown, to speak with American students in debates
and discussions.
"I felt like the sponsor thought it was a good opportunity," Xiang said. "Most of [the Chinese students] had never
been out of [China] before
I think it was just a fun chance
for them to tour around."
The event was organized into two separate panel discussions moderated by George Yin 'O9 and May Maani 10 in
which the students were presented with questions that
asked them to reflect on several current issues of China. The
discussions were then followed by a question and answer
session with the audience.
Swarthmore students were solicited to participate in the
event through Reserved Students Digest e-mails. The only
requirement was that interested students show a clear
awareness of China.
The panelists ranged from long-time students studying
Chinese to those simply interested in Chinese-US. political
relations. Xiang and fellow organizer Yimei Zou 10 also
recruited panelists from amongst their own friends.
"[The event] was to give students here an opportunity to
directly communicate with students from China," Xiang
said. "You hear a lot about China through mainstream
media, but
the main purpose was to give Swatties a
chance to talk to those students about some of the issues that
both were interested in." In the first panel, participants were
asked to think about the effect the Olympics may have on the
everyday lives of Chinese people and whether it would modify the current global perspective of China.
Other questions asked students to think about the reasons for the increase in the number ofChinese students coming to study abroad in the U.S., the differences in educational systems and each country's awareness of the other.
Katherine Lam 11, one of the student panelists, reflected
on the differences between the American and Chinese students in terms of their willingness to express their own personal opinions
as opposed to feeling restricted to represent only the views of their entire countries whether or not
they agreed with their governments.
"One of the biggest things that I noticed was how different our world views were," she said. "I feel that, being a
Swattie and an American, I can basically say everything I
want to ... but I felt like the Chinese students were a lot more
...

...

restrained."
In one specific instance, the Chinese panelists talked
about their government's preparations for the Olympics in
Beijing but seemed resistant to discuss the specific morality
of the actions of their government, according to Lam.

The second panel consisted of questions on Chinese
nationalism through sports and figures like Yao Ming, a
Chinese-American basketball player for the Houston
Rockets, the transition of China's economy to a consumer
economy similar to that of the U.S., the socioeconomic gap in
China, particularly between rural and urban populations,
and pressing environmental issues such as global warming
and pollution in Chinese society.
"Oftentimes, [the Chinese students'] responses were pretty diplomatic. They are very good at giving non-controversial answers to controversial questions," Yin said.
Andrew Dale 'OB, another student panelist, enjoyed the
overall experience but understood that perhaps the quality
of the debate was different from discussions that he has had
at Swarthmore.
He also emphasized the importance for future U.S.-China
relations to have events such as these to promote dialogue
between countries on an individual level.
"I strongly believe that relationships between countries
are built at the level of relationships between individuals
I was really happy and I enjoyed participating in this, but...

compared to some classes the quality of debate was just not

as high as I had hoped, especially considering how smart
they are and the achievements that these students have,"
Dale said. "They've done a lot. These students are intense
and undeniably intelligent. It's eye-opening for both people."
Yin said that China's colonial history may have affected
the ways in which its citizens feel they should discuss China,
leading to issues of miscommunication, differences in interpretation and unparalleled dialogue in these discussions.
"I sort of feel that the Chinese students were not open to
criticism enough from the U.5.," Yinn said. "I think that
actually reflects that China, in a sense, still can't really
it also shows that they are still in the

"I don't want to say that we were on opposing sides but...
it was like two ships passing in the night," Dale said. "Both
these boats were really close to each other but neither could

We weren't
really talking about the same thing."
Lam understood that there were inherent
differences in the ways in which both groups
of students would interpret and respond to
the questions, but also looked at it from the
perspective of her Chinese heritage. "I took

"They were really surprised," Xiang said. "They felt like
the Swarthmore panel discussion was the most challenging
one they faced. The Swarthmore delegates definitely had
given a lot of thought to the issues they were talking about."
After the event, student panelists and organizers were
invited to have dinner together. This allowed the students to
"mingle in a more informal setting," according to Xiang.
"I hung out with all these people after the event for a long
time and played Mahjong," Dale said. "I enjoyed hanging out
with them and it was a very good experience. They were
very willing to spend time with us after the event."

During the Q&A session of the second
panel, two Falun Gong activists stood up and
began to speak about the history of Falun
Gong practitioners in China, among other
things. Their comments were lengthy and
only loosely related to the topics discussed at
the event, and time had to be reserved for
other audience members to ask their own
questions, so at some point they had to be cut
off, according to Laura Post 'O9, a student
who had attended the event.
"Basically, the guy stood up and

Training for 'phoenix' mascot to begin
BY APOLLINE BERTY
abertyl@swarthmore.edu

Certain buildings around campus have been "feathered" in anticipation of the spring arrival of the college's
phoenix mascot. The mascot is currently in production
and tryouts will be held on March 29 to fill the bird suit.
The date of the mascot's debut is being kept under
wraps, but the phoenix is scheduled to arrive before the
end of the semester. The phoenix will make several
unexpected appearances throughout the semester before

the official release.
"We're not actually releasing a date as to that yet, it's
going to be more a surprise," Mascot Committee member Kyle White 'OB said. "That's generally how we've
been leading the campaign this semester, more elusive,
kind of secretive in a way, trying to get students more
engaged in it."

...

While the Mascot Committee wishes to keep the
design secret, it has hinted as to what the mascot will
look like. "When you think of a phoenix, you think
immediately of fire, flames, all that. Transpose those
ideas directly to a mascot, just think of one big flame
upward," White said of the mascot design.
The school has contracted with Raymond
Entertainment for the development and training of the
mascot, as well as for the creation of a personality for
the mascot. "[lt's] a little bit more quirky, rumpled, casual, approachable, I guess not so much in your face kind
of mascot, but more family friendly," White said, "If you
want to kind of transpose that into maybe the look of the
mascot, its feathers might be a little out of place here
and there and it has a backpack."
The mascot's appearances will be orchestrated by a
team consisting of the mascot character, an escort and a
mascot coordinator. Assistant Director of Student Life
and Academic Counselor Kelly Wilcox '97 will oversee
the mascot administrators. "We're creating a system
similar to the Party Associates
when requests come
in, I'll sit down with the mascot coordinator and decide
when and where the mascot will show up," Wilcox said.
Wilcox emphasized the thoroughness of the developing process. "We could've done it in three months, if
we'd picked from a catalogue, but it took over a year
because we wanted to do it right, to be a reflection of
Swarthmore values, to enhance what's good about
Swat," Wilcox said. "We probably went with the most
...

respected mascot designer and trainer out there,
[Raymond Entertainment] was the original Philly
Fanatic," Wilcox said. Raymond Entertainment provides not only the design and fabrication of the mascot,
but also a training camp for the mascot[s]-to-be.
The training camp, located 30 minutes away from
campus in Wellington, Delaware, will take place either
during the summer or right before the end of the semester, depending on the availability of the mascot. "The
training camp will prepare the students who fill the costume for the physical aspects of the job, as well as any
difficult situations they might run into and the social
aspects, such as crowd enhancement," Wilcox said.
Wilcox also expressed her hope of eventually having
the college train new generations of mascots itself, but
until then aspiring mascots will benefit from the high
quality training provided by Raymond Entertainment.
Tryouts to be Swarthmore's first mascot will take
place on March 29, incidentally the same day as Sager,
though at a different time. "Hopefully people see [the
tryouts] as a warm up to the night," Wilcox said. The
Mascot Committee is hoping that students will still come
and participate. "We encourage people to come be in the

audience. Part of the tryouts will be audience and crowd
interaction, so we definitely need a good crowd there
with lots of energy to get it going," Wilcox said.
Housing coordinator Liz Derickson 'Ol mentioned
some of the qualities desirable in a mascot representative such as "a stage presence, a real ability to be lively,
to connect with people, to inspire a crowd." White
explained that in order to gauge these attributes there
would be a small dance competition and a crowd pepping competition, along with other yet to be determined

activities.
This first tryout will be open to the campus and will
be "very American Idol, America's Next Top Model kind
of a thing," White said. The next day a closed tryout will
take place amongst the five or ten finalists. Each participant will wear the mascot suit, so as to make the judging process fair. "We will never know who is actually in
the suit," White said.
Those interested in being a mascot can sign up for
the Saturday, March 29 audition by e-mailing Kyle White
at kwhitel@swarthmore.edu. "Some people may be hesitant to nominate themselves so we're also taking nominations," White said. Either Kyle White or Kelly Wilcox
may be contacted with any questions.

Guns on campus
BY JESSICA ESTEPA
SAGEBRUSH (U. NEVADA-RENO)
(U-WIRE)
With Northern Illinois University's Feb. 14
shooting and the Virginia Tech shooting last spring on people's minds, the debate on whether guns on campus would
help make students safer continues.
"I see both sides," said Jessica Richards, a 21-year-old art
history major. "On one hand, people would be able to respond
faster if something like a shooting were to happen on campus.
At the same time, I don'tknow how I feel knowing the guy sitting next to me in class is armed."
Arizona, Georgia, Indiana,
Six state legislatures
introduced bills this
Kentucky, Ohio and South Carolina
year that would allow people with concealed weapons permits
to carry on public school and college campuses, according to
the National Conference of State Legislatures.
Three other legislatures
Alabama, Michigan and
Tennessee
are looking at bills that would allow faculty and
staff to carry concealed weapons on campus. Nevada isn't
among the states currently looking at the issue, but state senators and assemblymen agreed that campus safety would most
likely come up in the Nevada legislature's session next year.
Last October, Regent Stavros Anthony proposed arming
faculty after they went through training to become reserve
officers, but the Board of Regents voted against the proposal.
Anthony said he would not bring the proposal back, but
hoped that safety measures were being considered.
"We need to be able to defend and ensure the safety of our
students," he said.
University of Nevada, Reno President Milton Glick said he
wouldn't support the measure if the legislature brought up the
issue in its next session in support of allowing permit carriers
to bring concealed weapons on campus.
"That doesn't create a safer university," Glick said. "In my
opinion, no matter what security measures you take, if someone wants to carry a gun on campus and shoot others, then
they will. Adding more guns to that won't help the situation."
UNR Police Chief Adam Garcia said the police department
would also be against any proposals to allow permit carriers
to carry guns on campus, though they would enforce the policy if it did become law. "Most police officers would rather
respond to a shooting, not a shootout," Garcia said.
One student group, Students for Concealed Carry on
Campus (SCCC), has gained national attention in the debate.
The group started a few days after the Virginia Tech shooting
last year, which left 32 students and faculty dead. With more
than 19,000 members in its Facebook group, the students in the
group argue that concealed weapons would help in shooting
situations because students are able to respond faster than
police officers. The group does not have any chapters at
Nevada colleges. Since the Nothern Illinois Snooting a few
weeks ago, the group gained 8,000 members around the country, said Stephen Feltoon, SCCC's Midwest regional director.
"What we're trying to do is change state laws and school
policies to allow people to carry concealed weapons on campus and enhance their own personal safety," Feltoon said.
Feltoon pointed out that 12 colleges
all the public colleges and universities in Utah, Colorado State University in
Fort Collins, Colo, and Blue Ridge Community College in
Weyers Cave, Va. allow concealed weapons on campus and
have not had any violent incidents on their campuses.
But Garcia said there are no statistics that prove guns pre-

vent violence on campus or help in violent situations.
People for the idea argue that permit holders go through
sufficienttraining, so they wouldn'tbe endangering anyone.
In order to get a concealed weapon in Washoe County, a
person must fill out an application with the sheriffs office, be
21, take an eight-hour competency course, go through a background check and be fingerprinted, said Deputy Brooke
Keiths of the Washoe County Sheriffs Office. People applying
for permits cannot be convicted felons, judicially declared
incompetent or have any driving under the influence
charges over the last five years, among other requirements.
"It's ridiculous to say that these gun carriers would
harm people," said Robert Smith, president of the Nevada
State Rifle and Pistol Association. "People who are carrying
concealed weapons are some of the most trusted people."
But others say that any guns on campus make them feel
uncomfortable.
"I think it's a very frightening idea," said Kassi Stabler,
a 21-year-old philosophy major. "With all the shootings that
go on as it is, I don't want to know that people actually have
guns on top of that, on top of the worry of if someone just

From GENDER-NEUTRAL, p. 3
The question had three options: preferred gender-neutral bathrooms, indifferent and preferred separate gendered bathrooms. Over 45 percent of the respondents
stated that they were indifferent, indicating openness to gender-neutral bathrooms.

Lowell, himself a resident of an genderneutral hall in Worth said that he enjoyed
"living in a dorm that welcomes both those
who fit neatly into a gendered category
and those who don't," adding that, to his
knowledge "there have been no problems
in Worth or the Lodges this year surrounding gender-neutral housing or bathrooms."
While only two percent of respondents
stated that they prefer gender-neutral

bathrooms, that number indicates a desire
for the option of ungendered bathrooms on
campus, a desire that Derickson believes

will grow in the coming years. "Gendering

Brown athletes buy essays online
BY FRANKLIN KANIN
BROWN DAILY HERALD (BROWN U.)
(U-WIRE)

Athletes make up almost

half of students who purchase essays online
from Essayßay.com and most do so with the
approval of their coaches, according to a
study conducted by the custom essay site.

Essayßay writers prepare academic
essays, job applications and resumes for
their customers. In its "About Us" section,
the Web site says it "connects writers with
buyers that need custom essays, term
papers, theses and dissertations and allows
writers to offer their services directly based
on the strength of their reputation and past

results."
Jed Hallam, a representative for
Essayßay, said the site offers more than
most in the essay industry. "Some places do
free essays, but they're not customized to
the student's requirements," he said. "The
market needs to advance far enough to
where Essayßay is
where you can list a
word count, an academic level. You can
have someone from Oxford write your
essay."

"This campus needs to be
more trans-inclusive."
Cecilia Marquez 'll
According to Brown, the top priority of
the proposal is to make sure "students feel
safe and comfortable in the space they're
living in."
"It's important for students to be able to
make informed, mature decisions on their
own about their housing and their roommate since we, as students, spend so much
time in our rooms and deserve to have the
most positive of living experiences,"
Lowell said.

Derickson is confident that the proposal will be in place in time for next fall, citing gender-neutral housing as being one of
the "necessary steps to making
[Swarthmore] a more inclusive place."

Hallam described the process of buying
and posting as a "reverse auction." Buyers
are able to link the topic of the paper and all
the qualifications they want for it length,

ly it's become a surprise for America and
the American education system."

Kent Holland 'lO, who is on the men's

water polo team and also played the sport in

school, said he can understand the
pressure that would lead students to buy
papers from Web sites, though he said he
had not heard of Essayßay specifically.
"Definitely in high school there's a lot of
pressure," he said. "You're kind of on a
homework, classes, practight schedule
tice, then you come home and you have two
hours to do work before you have to get to
bed in order to get enough sleep for practice." But Holland said using this site just
hurts students in the long run. Students
should not go to a school they would not be
able to get into on their own, he said,
because they will just struggle academically once they get there.
Jose Yearwood 'OB, who plays football for
Brown, said balancing athletics and academics, though challenging, has given him
a better perspective on life. "I do agree that

recent controversy over coaches urging

years now to make sure their students are

Alum talks on political consciousness of queerness
Assistant professor of politics at NYU
Patrick Egan '92 returned to the college on
Monday to give a lecture addressing why
lesbians, gays and bisexuals tend to have
distinctively Democratic and liberal views
in the U.S., based on a survey he conducted.
Egan majored in sociology during his
time at Swarthmore. He wrote his senior
thesis on "how lesbians, gays and bisexuals fit into a broader progressive movement" and the connection between lesbians,
gays and bisexuals as a minority group
and other minority groups.
He was
advised by professor of sociology Joy
Charlton, who is now Executive Director of
the Lang Center.
Since his leaving the college, Egan has
worked in journalism, public policy, gay
and lesbian issues as well as other research

areas.

As a researcher, he discovered that there
was little research in the field of gay and
lesbian issues and sought to fill the gap he
saw in the literature. Increasing interest in
gay, lesbian and bisexual issues has also
pressured politicians to make these issues

"an agenda item," according to political
science professor Rick Valelly '75.
"The way [Egan] presented his conclusions was very lucid and on point. It was
very easy to follow the methodology behind
the number crunching," Hansi Lo Wang 'O9
said. "This is just the beginning of the
research in this field. I'm sure we will be
seeing many more enlightening discoveries

once we can get more data and widen the

sample and demographics that we study."

Phoenix news reporter

Mary Prager

recently sat down with Egan for an exclusive interview.

Mary Prager: In a nutshell, what
was your lecture about?
Patrick Egan: Essentially, it's about
how lesbians, gays and bisexuals establish distinctive political views in the
United States
The reason that I'm
studying this is that there's sort of this
puzzle, which is that generally, the way
that groups become politically cohesive
or believe similar things about politics is
through one of two mechanisms: one is
that they're raised in cultures that have
these values, so you think about Jews
tending to be liberal, or blacks tending to
vote for Democrats. They're raised in cultures that encourage and promote these
kinds of political views.
...

...

you
In other groups, like say unions
join a union and through contact with
...

union members, you learn what it means
to be a union voter, you know, you support Democrats or you support minimum
wage, whatever.
Well, gay people actually, they're not
raised in gay cultures or gay families,
generally, and so people say, "Oh, the reason that gay people are so liberal is that
they have contact with other gay people,
they learn these political values and attitudes from other gay people," and I start-

politically distinctive. They're more likely to vote for Democrats than straight people, more likely to identify as liberals, but
also more likely to be liberal on a whole
bunch of things that have nothing to do
with gay rights, like more likely to be
environmentalists, disapprove of the
Iraq war, etc.
All this leads me to think that something more profound is going on than
just gay people saying, well, which
party is best for gay people, and I'm
gong to vote for [that party], because it
seems to be the sort of basket of beliefs
that come together for, typically, les-

tend to be raised in less religiously fundamentalist homes and they're raised
in more accepting regions of the country than straight people.
So, if you think that sexual orientation is kind of randomly assigned to all
of us, only a portion of those people
who have sort of the interior trait of
homosexuality end up saying that
they're gay, and I argue that that decision depends-on the sort of affirmation
of the background in which you were
raised, and if you have more educated
parents, less religiously fundamentalist parents or a more favorable region

Ed the talk by sort of showing lots of
examples of how gay people are quite

bians and gays.
What I [did] in the talk is to show
that there are two other ways that gay
people become distinctive that have
nothing to do with whether or not they
have contact with other gay people.
With a survey that I designed and
fielded among lesbians and gays, I find
that lesbians and gay people come from
much more liberal backgrounds than
do straight people. So, their parents
tend to be much more educated, they

of upbringing, you're more likely to
respond to this interior trait by saying,
"Actually, I'm gay."
And there's another piece of the
puzzle, which is that the coming out
process for lesbians and gays is sort of
a conversion experience, politically.
Both the evidence that we see in

surveys and also the kind of circumstantial evidence we see from self-

reported political attitudes and behavior, indicate that the process of coming
out itself is associated with the acqui-

sition of liberal views on a whole

bunch of issues. And this happens
whether or not you have much contact

March 6, 2008

with gay people. So, for example, one
thing I find is that regardless of the prevalence of gay people in your neighborhood,
you are just as likely to be liberal if you
are gay in Greenwich Village as if you're
gay in Peoria.
There's no relationship between the
density of the gay population in your
immediate area and your political views,
[which] leads me to say that it doesn't
matter if you have lots of contact with
other gay people. If you're still adopting
liberal views, this suggests you don't
need contact in order to do that.
The big conclusion here is that the
choice to identify as gay or lesbian or bisexual in response to an interior trait, an
internal trait, is itself associated with
these distinctive political views, in a way
...

that doesn't require contact or association with other gay people. I can think of
no other demographic group in the U.S.
that actually has that same sort of story
about political views.

"The evidence... indicatefs]
that the process of coming
out itself is associated with
the acquisition of liberal
views."
Patrick Egan '92
Assistant professor, NYU
MP: So what led you to study this,
or to create a survey and investigate
this?
PE: There isn't much survey data
about gays, lesbians and bisexuals.
Generally, typical surveys of politics
don't ask respondents of their sexual orientation, and there's just a big gap in our
understanding of how a small minority of
the population becomes so unusually liberal and democratic, and it's particularly
interesting now, as gay and lesbian issues
have much more salience in American
politics than they did even twenty years
ago.

So it's interesting both in and of itself
like if you're interested in gay rights
but it's also interesting in a broader sense
of trying to figure out how anyone
acquires political views.

ALEX HO
Critical Mass Media
In the controversy surrounding the College Republicans'
"Coming Out" posters, (I promise, I won't be beating a dead
horse) one unexpected target of

attack was the Internet forum,
where much of the discussion
unfolded. On the Daily Gazette
forum, some comments asked
others to refrain from personal
attacks or ridiculed how petty the
whole thing was. The Daily Jolt,
of course, had far less civil com-

ments.

In spite of the unorthodox
writing in these Internet forums,
the depth and instantaneousness
of some of the discourse that they

produced made me anxious about
The Phoenix's continued relevance as a media source. As a
weekly publication, The Phoenix
can only publish Op-Eds at a
painfully slow pace. Sometimes,
discussion
of articles and
columns even transfer over to the
Net, as was the case with one of
Yoshi Johnson's columns on the
Jolt. Though, as the sole printed
newspaper on campus, the
Phoenix does have some institutionalauthority, this is also a hindrance that makes it less adaptable to changing media habits.
It's a situation I see paralleled in
an area that is my column's
bread and butter
pop culture
criticism, where I feel that the
Internet has really helped the
quality of work to flourish.
I have a mad love for blogs
and webzines about popular culture, and the site that started it
all was Slant Magazine. What
first struck me about the webzine

was that it didn't always slavishly praise prestige pieces like most
big-name papers did. Comprised
twenty-something, even collegeage, writers, the webzine struck
me as being far less smug than
established film critics. I liked
that their reviews were largely
unconcerned with taste and family-appropriateness, issues that
reduce the rating of a film to how
easily it goes down its audience's
throats. Instead, the reviewers
weren't afraid to get intellectual,
and they also weren't afraid to
use less formal language.
The Internet grants a far
greater freedom of language, no
matter how crude. While crude
or colloquial language can come
across as juvenile or unjustifiably mean, it can also be used in
clever ways to strengthen a point

have far less derision for socalled low culture, if only because
they reside in the gutter of
Internet trash.
That these blogs and webzines

means of critiquing popular culture. The option of starting a blog
is free to far more people, and the
personalization of a blog further

destructs the elitism of cultural
criticism and leaves the blogger
wide open to criticism.

Undoubtedly, there are plenty
of sickeningly pretentious blogs
out there. The Internet, as an
alternative to the oligarchy of
mass media, easily lends itself to

counterculture. But what's interesting is that much of the blogosphere seems to have fostered a
culture that calls out ego-stroking
contrarianism. Today's most
infamous film contrarian, the
New York Press's Armond White,
is cursed with an entire blog
titled "Armond Dangerous" that
monitors his every transgression. In many blogs I've found,
there is a self-awareness and selfcritiquing of the practice of cultural criticism. In the blog "The
Stranger Song," Paul Schrodt has
a post titled "Is film criticism
worthless?" that comes to terms
with how elitist and frivolous
film criticism has the potential to
become. In my opinion, the
Internet has made critics today
more understanding of the contradictions of their craft than any
previous generation of critics.
To conclude, I am eagerly
anticipating the Phoenix's new
website, so I can get me some vitriolic backlash. The only reactions I've received thus far have
been vaguely positive "I liked
your column" comments and I'm
aching to break loose from my
ivory (fourth floor Parrish) tower
and engage in the dynamic and
endlessly enlightening dialogue

that the Internet affords us.

'Scandal' unfolds at Swat
BY SUNNY COWELL

scowelll@swarthmore.edu
Ever wonder how famous detective Sherlock
Holmes would solve a mystery if he appeared in an
opera? Well, in "A Window On the Work: A Scandal In
Bohemia," Holmes does exactly that. Grappling with
questions of forgery and blackmail, Holmes made an
appearance on Swarthmore's very own campus on
Sunday, March 2 as the first act of the still-unfinished
opera was performed at Lang Music Hall.
With libretto by English professor Nathalie
Anderson and score by music professor Thomas
Whitman, the opera is based on the short story by
Sherlock Holmes author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. The
performance featured a cast, chorus and orchestra
comprised of both professionals and equally talented
Swarthmore students. Director John Alston prepared
the chorus and the musically gifted Mark Loria 'OB
directed the orchestra.
The opera centers on Sherlock Holmes as he
unravels a crime that takes place near his apartment.
In the first scene, composer Whitman ended up playing the part of Sherlock Holmes because the original
singer was, at the last moment, unable to make the
performance. Christine Duranza 'OB said "the musieven the
cians and singers did an amazing job
stand-in Sherlock Holmes was impressive considering
he was a last minute substitute".
In the second scene, American baritone Markus
Beam played Sherlock Holmes. Beam is an up and
coming singer in the international operatic scene.
Swarthmore's own Henry Clapp 'O9 played the parts of
Holmes sidekick Watson and Godfrey Norton.
...

Another guest artist, Laura Heimes, played Irene

Adler, the mysterious woman at the center of the
crime. Heimes, who has collaborated with many distinguished artists in early music such as Andrew
Laurence King, now teaches voice at the Westminster
Choir College.
Bass JulianRodescue played the Reader, the King
and the Minister. Rodescue has made important
appearances with the Philadelphia Orchestra, the
Boston Symphony and the Los Angeles Philharmonic.
Act I is set in London during the 1880s. The first
scene opens with melodies from the orchestra led by
alumnus Serena Le 'O7. Irene Adler is introduced as
"the woman" while Holmes is described as the "steel

cold reasoning machine." Holmes receives a mysterious letter that serves as the catalyst for the unfolding
events of the story. Moments of suspense are punctuated by the accompanying music as Holmes must
solve the crime using his reason over the reminder of
the opera.
The orchestra played an interlude before beginning the next scene, which takes place in Holmes'
study the following day. Holmes is late for a meeting
with Watson. The percussion mimics the sound of a
ticking clock to further portray the character waiting
a detail that was met with
for Holmes to arrive
much acclaim by the audience; according to Sara
Daley 10, the opera "was effectively orchestrated to
bring out instruments as appropriate sound effects".
To everyone's surprise, Holmes strolls in, pretending to be drunk, and the audience soon learns that
Adler has married Norton. As mentioned previously,
the opera is still a work in progress, so the performance unfortunately had to end with this cliffhanger.
Though it ended on an incomplete note, the crowd
still responded enthusiastically. Duranza said,
"Overall, the piece was very entertaining, and I can't
wait to come back next year to see the second halfof
it."

The Seventh International Junior Scholars'
Conference on Sinology will make its United States
debut this Friday, March 6. Over the weekend,
Swarthmore College will welcome a host of students and
faculty from around the globe to discuss issues pertaining to the study ofChinese culture. The conference, entitled "Self and Society: Perspectives on Chinese Cultural
Studies," will give youhg scholars a chance to present
their own research over the course of two panel-packed
days in the Kohlberg Scheuer Room.
Swarthmore's hosting of the International Junior
Scholars Conference is an event many years in the making. The initiative began several years ago when David
Wang, Harvard University's Edward C. Henderson
Professor ofEast Asian Languages and Cultures, came to
Swarthmore to give a lecture on modern Chinese litera-

Yin worked with Kong to come up with social
events such as a movie night and a tea party so that
the students can "have fun" while at Swarthmore.

According to Professor Haili Kong, Wang was "very
impressed with Swarthmore students' enthusiasm [for]
Chinese studies." Wang had previously organized six
conferences in Asia for "junior professors, post-doctorate researchers, and graduate students." His visit to
Swarthmore, however, gave him the idea of hosting a
similar conference not only in the United States but also
aimed at undergraduate students. Wang believed that
such an event would give professors the ability to 'tultivate interests among college students and then pave the
path for [students] to further develop in the future,"
Kong said. With this goal in mind, Wang approached
Kong about organizing the conference at Swarthmore.
Although the formative influences in the arrangement of the conference originated with Wang and

On the whole, Kahg hopes that the conference will
"further promote and cultivate the academic interests in Chinese studies at [the] college level world

conference will be an opportunity to "increase awareness about a lot of different issues in relation to modern and traditional Chinese culture." With such a CjL

On the other end of the spectrum, Fletcher

artists in addition to "regular people" about how tattoo art is viewed in Chinese society. "In China, there

A grand old 'Times'

phoenix.swarthmore.edu

'Entropy' draws a crowd at Kitao Gallery

BY JOAN KIM

jkim3@swarthmore.edu

'

Silence. Plays rely on poetic words but the pauses in
between the dialogue can structure the most powerful
moments in a scene. Playwright Harold Pinter took
advantage of the power of creating uncomfortable
dynamics on stage to take the audience to a different
level of understanding and misunderstanding. For her
Honors Acting thesis, Rachel Sugar 'OB starred in
Pinter's play "Old Times," carrying out the playwright's imaginative vision.
A flicker of warm light disrupts the darkness as a
small flame lights a cigarette. A woman's blase expression is all that is visibleuntil the theater lights turn up.
The initial moments of "Old Times" set the scene in a
English countryside house occupied by husband and
wife, Deeley and Kate, played by Stephan Graf 'O9 and
Sugar. The couple receives a visitor, Anna, played by
Stephanie Duncan 'OB. Anna, Kate's strong-spirited
friend from 20 years past, unearths memories of their
escapades in London. The three characters reveal different versions of these memories to each other and to
the audience, only to realize that their stories are intertwined with each other even though Deeley and Anna
believe they are meeting for the first time. One such
moment is when Deeley recounts meeting a girl during
visit to a London tavern only to discover from Anna's
version of the story that the girl was she.
As several of the recalled events are echoed in the
present time of the play, the truth of each skewed recollection is left to be determined by the audience.
Throughout the play, Kate's two companions, past and
present, struggle to possess Kate through their competing memories.
Sugar chose this psychologically intriguing play
because of a recommendation from theater professor
Elizabeth Stevens. "It's an incredible, beautiful script.
It's a real challenging script and it required a subtlety
thathad never been required of me before," Sugar said.
The dialogue itself was filled with innuendo and witty
banter that pushed tensions to the edge, but the lack of
action in the scenes left a great deal to be interpreted by
the actors.
"Dramaturgically, it was harder to figure out. There
is a plot but nothing happens on stage," Sugar said.
According to Sugar, the final product was a result of
many trials and errors. Sugar herself underwent seri-

ous preparation for her role. "My director had me
watch a lot of movies
both old movie stars and contemporary actresses whom she felt had the same
inscrutability of Kate, my character," she said. Sugar
also drew inspiration from a program note ofanother of
Pinter's plays, "The Birthday Party," which said that
during rehearsal, the director spoke to individual
actors about their roles but kept those conversations
private from the rest of the cast.
Sugar found this idea to be helpful for "Old Times"
since everyone in the cast did not share the same set of
experiences. "Memory is so intertwined," said Sugar.
"The characters don't remember the same events.
Mundane exchanges are so loaded and none of it is said
explicitly."
Pinter kept to his style in "Old Times," where the
depth ofeach character is revealed little by little to both
the other characters on stage and to the audience. The
actors created a level ofuneasiness and tension on stage
which ironically belied the high level of ease and comfort among the cast. The audience squirmed at every
awkward moment and walked out with a greater appreciation for the complex nature of each character.
Sugar took on a great acting challenge, which was all

the more difficult sinceKate is less vocal than the other
characters. She remained a powerful presence on stage
even when silent, fully captivating the audience.
"Rachel is so intense in a freaky, ethereal, bizarre
way and Stephanie was intense in her own way," Louis
Jargow 10 said. "Rachel and Stephanie have been acting together for a long time and they have the best
chemistry I've seen on stage." Although Jargow felt the
set and the directing left something to be desired, he felt
that the acting brought everything together.
Sugar, Graf and Duncan's performance has even
some inspired students to delve deeper into works of
Pinter. "I've always been a big fan ofPinter... [The production] made me check out "Old Times" from the
library so I could read it again," Leah Rethy 10 said.

would have killed his wife if, hypothetically, he

Thinking about these shows, and about the

Brasov is ringed by Southern
Carpathians or Transylvanian Alps,
which leads me to another potential
tourist slogan: "Brasov: If you thought
that Hollywood was the only city that
decorated its hills with its name on an

ugly neon sign, think again."
The sign aside, the constant sight of
forested mountains was a refreshing
change after two months in achingly
flat Budapest. On my second day there,
I made a point of hiking around for a
couple hours, breaking mid-way to

NATALIE BOWLUS
Ki Vagy?!
Transylvania: not just for transsexual transvestites. That's not the
Romanian government's official tourist
slogan, but I'm pretty sure I'm not the
only one who thinks it should be.
If the Hungarian government had a
slogan for Transylvania, it might be
something like "You used to be part of
our country please come back!" I'm
joking (sort of) and I could take the joke
further, but I won't because it makes
me feel guilty. I'm also willing to bet
I'm the only Swarthmore student who
thinks irredentism can be funny.
My first banal statement in this column is that Transylvania is really big.
Thus, my exploration thereof was limited to the three days I spent in the

town of Brasov. I arrived via overnight
train, my first brush with that seeming
relic of la belle epoque. I mistakenly
purchased a berth in a proper sleeper
car, so while my companions were
stuck for 13 hours in what amounted to
a glorified Sharpies booth (admittedly
one with three layers of pull-out
bunks), I had a cozy bed in a room I
shared with only two complete

strangers. We had our own mirror and
complimentary bottles of water; if it
had been the Titanic, we would have
gotten on lifeboats.
Generally speaking, overnight train
travel is possibly one of the best things
ever. You go to sleep and wake up in a

worked that way. The one disadvantage is disorienting late-night (or
3 a.m. early) passport checks by
brusque guards in heavy quilt...

ed coats that remind me a little
too much of what I imagine
the KGB to have been like.
Maybe this Cold-War era paranoia is what made me feel like

my American passport alwa
got an extra going-over. Ther
again, it could also be my
immeasurable narcissism.
Even the sun was
only just waking up
when we arrived. Our
hostel (thoughtfully
booked in advance)

T

admire the view of the city and the
occasional mounds of what I can only
surmise were bear droppings. Before
any frivolous enjoyment of nature,
however, I needed to pay my respects to
Romania's own Mecca, at least for vampire enthusiasts: Dracula's castle, also
known as Castle Bran.
Not to break any hearts, but the cas
tie is remarkably underwhelming anc
the closest Vlad the Impaler came to
living there were the two days he was
allegedly locked in the castle dungeon
by the Ottomans. But, if you think this
would prevent people from capitalizing

on the myth, think again: rather than
making any effort to dispel the Dracula
myth, or at least point out Brasov's
other cultural attributes, the govern
ment has launched an aggressive mar
keting campaign by land, air and sea
(This is doubly impressive in light o
the country's land-locked nature.)
As a result, at Bran Castle you can
buy Dracula mugs, Dracula t-shirts

Dracula

puppets,

paper

weights and Dracula shot glasses, to
name a few items. Lest I depart entire
ly from this semester's food-and-alco
hoi theme (see the illustrations for my
previous two columns), you can also
purchase more than one brand of vam
pire-themed wine.
Finally there were the items only
tangentiaUy related to Vlad, if at all
namely, neon Mohawk wigs, tradition
al Romanian lace tablecloths and very
expensive fur hats. I would say that the
area of the tourist market wasn't quite
twice as big as that of the castle, bu
pretty close.
Late in the day, we made it back to
the town center, despite our minima
knowledge of Romanian and our inabi]
ity to make heads or tails o

Well, it's official. Reality television has
destroyed another marriage.
According to that gold standard of journalism, the New York Post, the reality show "The
Moment of Truth" has cost one of its contestants her marriage. For those of you who don't
know, "The Moment of Truth" is a game show
in which contestants are hooked up to a polygraph machine and, in front of family and
friends, asked a series of increasingly personal
questions. For every answer the polygraph
machine says is true, the amount of money the
contestant can win goes up, but once an answer
is deemed untruthful, the contestant loses all of

his or her money.
In the case of Lauren Cleri, her marriage to
her husband Frank was broken by her admission that she had sex with another man after
marrying Frank, that she was still in love with
another boyfriend on her wedding day and that
she still believed that the old boyfriend was the
right man for her. In a painful twist, this knowledge didn't even win the couple any money to
pay for therapy sessions; when asked if she
thought she was a good person, Lauren
answered "yes." The polygraph recorded her
answer as a lie, stripping her of all her winnings and leaving her out of the spotlight and
with her heartbroken and humiliatedhusband.
Not surprisingly, "The Moment of Truth" is
brought to you by the good people at the FOX
network. This misguided exercise in so-called
honesty was greenlighted by the same network
executives who brought the abhorrent "The
Swan" to primetime. If you don't remember this
appalling concept, "The Swan" took a group of
unattractive, insecure women, gave them lots of
plastic surgery so that they would conform to
society's standards of beauty and then pitted
them against each other in a beauty contest
during which one, and only one, would be given
the title of "Swan." Fox was also responsible for
the much-derided O.J. Simpson special "If I Did

It." The show

-

which never aired due to

protests from the family of victim Nicole Brown

producers who approve of the exploitation of
normal people in the name of entertainment,
makes my blood boil. I can't, however, place all
the blame for this onslaught ofbad taste on the
people who broadcast them. Some of the blame
must be apportioned to the people who, like
Lauren Cleri, choose to appear on such a show
with full knowledge that their darkest secrets
are about to be dragged out into the bright light
of the game-show set. The women on "The
Swan" chose to risk emotional pain in an
attempt to achieve physical perfection; Lauren
Cleri chose to risk her marriage for money. The
biggest problem with Cleri's actions are not the
consequences for herself, which she must have
foreseen going in. Rather, her gravest moral
error lay in dragging her husband (who seems
to have had faith in her honesty and their marriage) onto national television, where anyone
with a TV set could watch his heart break in
real time.

Placing some of the blame with the contestants is, in my mind, a legitimate move; however, giving credit where credit is due is not
meant to absolve the audiences who watch

these shows. Let's face the facts: without the

huge numbers that these shows draw, none of
the contestants would be given the chance to

hurt themselves or their loved ones on air.
We, the educated, intelligent population of
Swarthmore might choose to chalk up the success of "The Moment ofTruth" to Nascar-watching, trailer-dwelling hillbillies whose tastes
couldn't be farther from our own. But don't
count out the educated elite when discussing
reality television. Once I walked in on my
enlightened, liberal, feminist mother watching
an episode of "The Swan." When I, feeling very
righteously indignant, asked her what could
have possessed her to watch this exercise in
degradation, she gave me a reply that taught me
a lot about the way the world works: "Because
it's like a train wreck, and as much as I want to
look away, I can't."
No matter how often we complain about the
repulsive foundations of shows like "The
Moment of Truth" and "The Swan" (not to mention gems like "Joe Millionaire" and

"Temptation Island"), we will keep watching,
because the grotesque and bizarre fascinates
humanity in a way that high art never will. If
we really want to wipe the vast wasteland of television free of dubious enterprises such as
these, we need to overcome our fascination
with the deformedand damaged. I don'tknow if
it can be done, but I will still try. You won't
catch me watching "The Moment of Truth," no
matter how much I might want to tune in and
watch the flames climb higher.

Almaliky characterized the music as

BY ALEX HO
ahol@swarthmore.edu

The Middle Eastern Culture Week
came to a sonorous close this past
Saturday with "Music and Memory:
Legacy in the New World," a concert of
classical and modern Arabic music performed by UCLA professor and ethnomusicologist A.J. Racy and the Philly-based
MidEast Ensemble.
LPAC was packed with not only college students, but also many people from
the Middle Eastern community of the
greater Philly area. A concert dedicated
to Arabic music does not seem to be a
common sight in the U.S. As one of the

members of the audience, Muhamed
Almaliky, said of the performance, "This
was really very rare."
Before the audience could get to see
Racy and Mid East Ensemble, they were
first treated to a performance, titled
"Zaman," by the Al-Bustan Percussion
Ensemble, which was comprised of middle school and high school students and
led by master percussionist Joseph
Tayoun.

The ensemble is a part of Al-Bustan
Seeds of Culture, a non-profit organization that co-sponsored the event with
Swarthmore College's Middle Eastern
Culture Society. Director Hazami Sayed
explained in the concert's introduction
that the organization works to "expose
children and youth to Arabic culture."
At the start of the concert, Racy
explained that the performance would be
the culmination of his only recent collaboration with the MidEast Ensemble.
Both Racy and the ensemble members
were ecstatic to be working together.
Tayoun, who is also part of the ensemble,
said, "I can't tell you what an honor it's
been to work with A.J. Racy. We've listened to his music for quite a long time
that to be on the same stage with him
it's almost overwhelming." After a par-

ticularly crowd-pleasing piece, Racy also
said, "You can imagine what a pleasure it
was to work with them."

"The nice thing was how
[AJ. Racy] added the
percussion, which is such
a modern thing into an old
theme."
Muhamed Alma I iky

from as far back as "Andalusia, when the
Arabs were in Spain."
The program gradually picked up to
more recent, folk tunes that had much of
the audience familiarly humming along.
Among them were "Longa Shahnaz" a
popular tune from the Ottoman era and
several pieces by Egyptian musician
Sayyid Darwish.
With one of Darwish's songs, the 1919
"11-Hilwa Dih," Racy filled in the lyrical
content that the audience would not be
able to hear, explaining that "the song
encourages craftsmen and workers to
just work hard and you will find success."

"We've listened to [AJ.
Racy's] music for quite a
long time that to be on the
same stage with him, it's
almost overwhelming."

Almaliky said, "The nice thing was
how [Racy] added the percussion, which

is such a modern thing, into an old
theme, and that made it very interesting.
He
transcended many decades, even
centuries, and brought them together."
The ensemble's percussion section was a
three-man machine made up of Tayoun
and his brother William Tayoun along
with Hafez El Ali Kotain.

own medley, which elicited the loudest
audience reaction of the night. Making
full use of every one of their fingers, the
percussionists had many audience members with mouths agape.
It was not only a masterful performance. The concert was also probably, for
many in the audience, a crash course in
the various instruments of Arabic music
that are seldom heard in other world
music. One of the most prominent Arabic
instruments is the lute-like 'ud, which
was played throughout the night by
Roger Mgrdichian.
Racy also introduced

a reed flute
use it," Racy
said, "and they look at that flute sound as
something that is conducive to spiritual
transcendence."

The program paid equal homage to
classical music, folk music and more
modern stylings, with many pieces being
Racy's own compositions.
Many of the pieces were performed in
the form of a medley, which traditionally
begins with a solo prelude that is heavily
improvised, then brings in the entire
ensemble and ends with a lighter, more

upbeat tune.
Racy and the ensemble began their
concert at the beginning with pieces that
"belong to a repertoire that we may refer
to as classical music

very old."

Among the other instruments that
Racy played, the buzuq, a string instrument with metal strings and a ridiculous
number of frets along its ridiculously
long neck, might just be any metal rocker's fantasy.
Finally, there was the mijwiz, a reed
double-pipe that "is a typical instrument
you find in Arab weddings," according to
Racy.

In taking its audience through the

various ages ofArabic music, the concert
more than lived up to its name. Racy and

Housing
Liz
Coordinator
Derickson 'Ol and the other members
of the Housing Committee have rec-

ommended that both housing in

Willets basement and the first floor of
David Kemp be made gender-neutral
to permit roommate pairs of any gender. In carrying the change in housing policy to its logical conclusion,
they also recommended that the bathrooms in Willets basement and on the
first floor of David Kemp become gender-neutral. We support the housing
committee's efforts to expand genderneutral housing on campus, which

would make college housing more
accessible to all students, regardless of
gender identity or sexual orientation.
Yet, we feel that the administration
should expand gender-neutral housing on campus even further. We are
not advocating that all bathrooms
should be gender-neutral, but rather
that gender-neutral bathrooms should
be accessible to all students and that
gender-neutral housing be more widely available.

The committee's recommendations
were driven by a perceived shortage

Woolman, with gender-neutral bathrooms available on campus in
Wharton CD, Worth/Lodges, PPR,
Strath and Woolman, but the concentration of gender-neutral rooms offcampus conflicts with the college's
commitment to equal opportunity.
Gender-neutral housing is important to students who identify as gender queer because they should be free

to choose a roommate regardless of
their gender or the gender of their
potential roommate. They should not
be bound by a traditional definition of
gender as defined by the standard
housing policy. It is also important
for students who identify as queer to
be free to choose a roommate with
whom they will be comfortable. If

they are not comfortable living with
someone of the same gender, they
should have the option of living with
someone else. They currently do in
certain places, but there should be
more options. Dana, Hallowell and
other gender-neutral housing options
should not be the exceptions to the
rule; there should not be a rule.
Finally, it is important that all students be free to choose any roommate.

We are all adults and we should be
trusted to make adult decisions. Once
we graduate, there are no restrictions.
Why should Swarthmore, of all institutions, impose them?
A traditional objection to the introduction of gender-neutral accommodations is that heterosexual students
may experience discomfort if they are
assigned to live in close proximity to
queer or transgender students. Part of

coming to college is getting exposed to
new people, new ideas and unfamiliar
living conditions. Neighbors who take
advantage of the gender-neutral
option will not harm anyone on the
hall. If studentsfeel this way, maybe a
little exposure will not hurt them.
Another traditional objection is that
couples
who are romantically
involved will opt to live together.
However, even now both queer and
straight romantic couples can and do
cohabitate. Nonetheless, we hope that
romantically-involved students will
know better than to risk potential
drama by living together.
Some students, including survivors, have reasons for wanting to
live on a gendered hall. These students object to gender-neutral housing
on the grounds of perceived lack of
safety around members of the opposite gender. Their concerns are legitimate, as safety is paramount to student housing. Thus, some gendered
housing should remain for such stu-

dents. Unless there is a dramatic

increase in the demand for gendered

housing, only Parrish, the third floor
of Dana and Kyle should remain gendered. We feel that the college should
try to make as many students as
happy as possible when it comes to
gender-neutral housing.

technique the
CIA refers
to as an
a

"enhanced
interroga-

tion tech-

nique." The process involves strapping someone
to a board, elevating their feet and covering their
eyes. Water is then poured on the person's body,
while water is simultaneously poured down their
nose and throat, which simulates drowning. This
process is repeated until the individual either
divulges the information their captors are interested in, or the person is rendered unconscious.
In the event that the person loses consciousness,
they are revived and the process begins again.
Waterboarding sounds similar to what we
used to call torture, does it not? But, you might
say, the U.S. government would never torture
people in order to extract information from
them, would they? The simple answer is, yes.
Newsweek reported last month that Bush administration officials have admitted to using waterboarding on suspected terrorists in 2002 and 2003.
The implementation of waterboarding has
allowed the U.S. government to go down in history with all the other famous propagators of the
technique, such as the Khmer Rouge and the
Spanish Inquisition.
Vice President Dick Cheney seemed unconcerned by the nature of waterboarding in 2006
when he said, "A dunk in water is a no-brainer if
it can save lives." This statement aroused a bit of
a ruckus among human rights activists, and
Cheney noted a few days later that he was not
referring to the practice of waterboarding. If
Cheney was not referring to the practice of
waterboarding, what was he referring to?
Perhaps a pleasant swim? Not likely; he most certainly was referring to the practice of water-

boarding.

Even if waterboarding could possibly save
lives, we set a bad precedent for the future by
using such techniques. In condoning the use of

torture techniques such as waterboarding we are
setting ourselves on a path down a slippery slope.
Where is the limit to how much we should torture someone in order to benefit society as a
whole? If we accept the practice under any circumstance, the line between when we should and
should not use torture techniques grows continuously ambiguous.

According to a statement made by a Pentagon

official in a Washington Post Article, the Defense
Department has examined at least thirty-five
interrogation techniques, twenty-four which are

approved under a "classified directed." The
refused to disclose the twenty-four
interrogation procedures currently being used
on prisoners of Guantanamo Bay.
But those are suspected terrorists, aren't
they? Surely, the U.S. government would not
detain and torture innocent people, right?
Wrong. In September of 2006, the New York
Times reported the story of a man named Maher
Arar, a Canadian citizen who was taken captive
at JFK international airport in September of 2002
on his way home from a vacation. Mr. Arar was
transported to Syria by the U.S. government
where he spent almost a year in a jail cell, being
periodically tortured with a device he described
as a shredded electric cable. He was imprisoned
until October of 2003, when he was released after
the U.S. government realized they had arrested
him on erroneous information. The mistakes
made involving Mr. Arar's case have significantly impacted U.S. intelligence relations with
Canada, and the Washington Post adds that,
"other cases of rendition have similarly upset

How far are we really willing to allow the federal government to overstep its bounds when
making judgments it claims to be "vital to national security?" Napoleon Bonaparte was once quoted saying, "Religion is excellent stuff for keeping

common people quiet." To me, this "war on terror" jazz is nothing more than a contemporary

in the fight against
genetically modiorganisms,
fied
there are two main
positions
being
categorically
-

GMO's offer different benefits and, to a certain extent,
different costs. Let's start with golden rice, a pretty classic case of genetic engineering coming to the rescue. It's
enriched with vitamin A so as to prevent blindness and
decrease mortality due to vitamin A deficiencies. It's free
of patents and ready for distribution to impoverished
farmers worldwide as a permanent substitute for planting normal rice.
Two GMOs that are already in heavy rotation in the
United States are pest-resistant and herbicide-resistant
corn. Despite common misconceptions, both of these
GMO's have actually resulted in a significant reduction
in herbicide and pesticide use. Pest-resistant corn produces its own species-specific pesticide so that farmers
don't have to spray any. Bugs are also killed somewhat
more selectively, leaving untargeted insects alive and
well. Herbicide-resistant varieties prevent the need to
repeatedly spray a field with several specialized herbicides in order to leave the actual crop untargeted, reducing total herbicide use.

against
genetic
engineering
and

being specifically against the application of genetic engineering to agriculture. This week, I'm going to address
that second position.
Any basis for this opinion must stem from a practical
argument, not a moral one. Genetic engineering is
responsible for most of the drugs you take when you're
sick, the gene therapy your uncle is undergoing and
maybe even the extra-awesome yeast that fermented your
wine. If you accept the benefits of GMO use in areas that
directly affect your life, as the vast majority of people do,
then it is hypocritical to make a moral argument against
genetic engineering specifically when it is applied to
agriculture. And as I established last time, there is simply no ethical basis for rejecting genetic engineering in
all these aspects of your life. If you do, you'd have to be
even more hardcore than the scientologists and probably
be living in the woods somewhere, in which case, I doubt
you'd get your hands on a copy of the Phoenix.
For a pragmatic analysis of GM crops, we need to
explore this case-by-case, simply because different

Despite common misconceptions,
[pest-resistant and herbicide-

resistant corn] have actually
resulted in a significant reduction in
herbicide and pesticide use.
Of course, there are associated costs and risks. GM
crops may transfer their traits to wild populations the
same way that regular domesticated crops will cross-pollinate neighboring wild varieties, changing the gene
pool. There is the chance that inserted genes won't
remain stable over generations and that there will be
unwanted or harmful mutations. And while we know a lot
about the long-term effects of genetic engineering in the
lab and the short-term effects of GMOs in the environment, we don't know much about the long-term impacts

the

of planning ahead. One is the
Pennsylvania primary, which will be
held on April 22. The other is March
24, the voter registration deadline
for anyone who wants to participate
in the primary.
As citizens, students, Democrats

and supporters of Barack Obama, we
have been working extremely hard
to ensure that every student who is
eligible to vote in PA can be registered for April's primaries. Having a
large student turnout at the polls
will not just help our chosen candidate as it will help give a voice to
students and young people who are
consistently viewed as an unimportant part of the political process. For

Democrats especially, this year's primary is the most important in
decades, and we want everyone, no
matter whom they support, to get
involved in the process of choosing

the Presidential candidate.
Swarthmore students, first-years
and seniors included, are eligible to
vote in this state. In order to vote on
April 22, you need to be 1) registered
to vote in Pennsylvania and 2) registered as a Democrat or Republican.
If you registered before as an
Independent or with no party affiliation at all, you will not be allowed to
vote in the primaries, so take this
opportunity to change your registration and make your voice heard. If
registered
you
at
previously

but have changed
precincts by moving on- or off-campus since then (off-campus residences include ML, PPR and Strath
Haven) you should re-register.
Finally, if you are registered in
Swarthmore

another state but haven't voted in a
primary this year, you can change
your registration to PA with no
penalty whatsoever.
We've had great success storming
the dorms and tabling in Sharpies,
and will be continuing to do so right
up until the registration deadline to
make sure everyone has an opportunity to participate in the primaries.
In order to meet our goal of 100 percent participation, we need all the
help we can get, now and on election
day. There are many ways you can

of GMOs on surrounding ecosystems. Although we
haven't seen any disasters on the 122 million acres of GM
crops the United States currently plants, there could be
serious negative impacts that will only become apparent
over time.

I think the good outweighs the bad
for at least some GM crops
science-wise, the GMO story is not
a horror story.
...

So there are significant risks and biotechnology
should be closely regulated, especially in regards to ecological impact. But when evaluating the cost of GMOs, it
is important to realize that the alternative is not a costfree baseline. What we should actually be comparing to
the cost of GMOs is the cost of the existing agricultural
practices that GMOs would supplant, such as high herbicide and pesticide use, which are known to have ongoing
and significant negative ecological impacts. When evaluated in this way, the costs and risks associated with
GMOs don't clearly come out as the worst of the two
options.

Looking at the science, I think the good outweighs the
bad for at least some GM crops. However, what hasn't yet
been brought up are the social implications, and some
really serious negative impacts lie in this area. But the
effect of GMOs on agribusiness, specifically on the continued planting of vast monocultures of the same plant
and on the power of seed companies, is a whole new
topic. What I want to make clear is that science-wise, the
GMO story is not a horror story. It's also not a fairy tale.
But just because there's no magic wand doesn't mean
that we shouldn't take a realistic look at all the tools in
our arsenal.

Women's tennis crushes McDaniel, 9-0 Tiger continuing
to turn our heads
BY JOSH ABEL

This past Saturday, March X
Swarthmore's women's tennis

team opened up its Centennial

Conference schedule with a comdominant victory over

pletely

McDaniel College.

MCDANIEL

SWARTHMORE

Playing indoors at the Mullan
Tennis center, the Garnet blasted
the Green Terror 9-0, losing only
one game in the nine matches.
The Garnet swept through the
doubles competition with ease,
winning all three eight-game pro
sets 8-0.

Then, the top 3 singles positions squared off. Jennie Park 'O9

and Jamie Midyette 'OB, playing
first and second, respectively,
breezed their way to 6-0, 6-0 victories. At third singles, Rebecca
Commito 'lO dominated her oppo-

nent thoroughly also, but did yield
a game. She was forced to settle
for a 6-0, 6-1 victory.
With the Garnet up by six
matches with just three left to pla-

y, it was decided that the fourth,
fifth and sixth singles players
would play eight-game pro sets, as
opposed to the longer three-set format. Luann Cignavitch 'll, Sofia
Gall 'O9 and Kearney Bangs 'lO all
cruised to 8-0 victories.

For those counting, that's a
combined game score of 84-1.
This is pretty close to as thor-

ough a beating as one tennis team

can inflict on another. And the
Swarthmore women did so while
not playing with their usual top
singles player, Rachel Wallwork
'lO.
Playing in a lopsided match
like the one on Saturday is a very
different experience than playing
in a typical, competitive match.
Such clean-cut victories often
cause a change in approach. "A
match like Saturday is a great
opportunity to try out some shots
you may not be comfortable trying
in a more competitive match
Being able to win points off these
shots gives you confidence to use
them in those more competitive
matches," Commito said.
The Garnet did a tremendous
job of handling the lack of competition, as the 84-1 aggregate game
score would suggest, though
Commito laments that it was probably a drop in her focus that cost
her a game in the second set of her
...

singles match.

"Staying focused and *up' for a
match when you know you are the
better team can be a real challenge. I thought we did a very nice
job of staying within our game

plan and not letting their play dictate how we executed. We'll definitely keep those lessons for our
future matches when we play
against the top teams of the conference," Coach Jeremy Loomis

said.

The team certainly welcomed
its impressive showing after its
tough loss to New York University,
4-5, a week prior. The team is now
1-1 overall and 1-0 in the
Centennial Conference.

"[W]e did a very
nice job of staying
within our game plan
and not letting their
play dictate how
we executed."
Jeremy Loomis
Head Coach
The win over McDaniel was the
team's last match before spring

break, but the women will be quite
busy over break. They will be
spending six days in Spain. "We'll
be playing three days on the red
clay against Spanish women's tennis teams and also experiencing
the Iberian culture. It's going to be
a memorable trip," Loomis said.
The trip should prove to be an
important team-building experience, in addition to being a lot of

fun.

Saturday's match was a good
step in that same process. You may never see a beating that thor-

ough again, at the collegiate level

or any other.

Get Down With
Your Bad Self

Golf was never really
something that appealed to
me whenever I would be
flipping through channels.
Too boring, too quiet, too
slow. I simply could never
bring myself to watch any
golf on TV, other than highlights of men and women
making what appeared to
be pretty spectacular shots.
Regardless of how many
golfers
would
make
Sportscenter's Top 10 Plays,
there was just never
enough action for me to
really become interested.

After a conversation with
one of my roommates a few weeks ago I slowly began to realize
that something pretty incredible was going on in golf and I
should probably start watching it before I miss it. That thing is
Tiger Woods, undeniably one of the premier golfers ever and possibly the most dominant athlete on the planet.
I saw on the news the other day that Tiger won his 63rd
career event, whichputs him at for fourth all time, skipping over
golflegend Arnold Palmer. Reflecting on that number I realized
that this guy is pretty amazing.
He simultaneously holds all three worlds titles, he is consistently voted the PGA Player of the Year, he has been named
Sports Illustrated Sportsman of the Year twice, he holds all sorts
ofrecords and he is the highest paid athlete on the planet. I mean
this guy makes bank. He has his own line of clothing, his own
videogame, his own line of golfproducts; Tiger even has his own
Gatorade!
Certainly Tiger Woods is one of the most recognizable athletes on the planet and I have not once watched him play golf on
TV. Surely by JeffLazarus standards, my sports fan membership
is on the verge of being outright revoked.
Perhaps it has to do with my ugly foray into the world of golf,
an endeavor that ended extremely poorly for many a golf product. My father and I try to play at least one round of golf a year,
and somehow in the dozen or so times we have played in the past
several years we have managed to break multiple clubs (including the same club three or four times). Don't even get me started
on what happens to golf balls when I play. Though my dad usually keeps track of most of his, let's just say I've left a lot ofbrave
men down in the field over the years. I just can't hit the damn
thing straight, it's infuriatingly simple. Notwithstanding my
inability to play golf, certainly I should beable to watch it on TV,
especially to see something as epic as Tiger Woods bringing the
noise all over the sport of golf.

Tiger Woods is admirable to me
because he has chosen what
he wants to do with his life and
he does it better than anyone
else
[T]he guy is a killer.
...

It seems as though I will need to put my childish fury at the
sport of golf aside so that I can truly take in and understand who

Tiger is and what he is doing for the sport.
Aside from having more sponsors than any single human
being I have ever seen, Tiger seems to be a pretty standup guy. I
hear about him donating to charity and being a family-oriented
man and I don't hear about him doing HGH and then throwing
his wife under the bus saying that she was the one who used it.
Tiger Woods is admirable to me because he has chosen what he
wants to do with his life and he does it better than anyone else.
To put it bluntly the guy is a killer. He has won four PGA Tour
events in a row, and is only ten wins away from tying Jack
Nicklaus on the all-time list of PGA Tour wins, having played
less than half the number of starts as Nicklaus. Anyone who can
do that certainly deserves not only my attention, but also the
attention of all people who consider themselves sports fans.
Consider it my belated sports New Year's Resolution: to
watch more golf so that when I am old and gray, I can tell the
young'uns how I watched Tiger Woods make historyKevin is a sophomore.

Men’s lacrosse opens up season
BY LAUREN WALKER

lwalkerl@swarthmore.edu
Swarthmore's men's lacrosse team kicked off its 2008

season in Ashland, Va., on Saturday with a win against

Randolph-Macon College, defeating the Yellow Jackets 7-2.
The Garnet (1-0) didn't waste any time after the first
whistle blew, as Gavin Musynske 'lO put an unassisted
goal into the Yellow Jackets' net just 3:19 into the game.

the back of the

net again off an

assist
from
lios Wilson 'O9. After these two goals were netted, both
teams went scoreless for the rest of the half, as the entire
second quarter showed impressive defensive performances on both ends of the field.

After halftime, however, the Garnet stepped up the
offensive power.
Before three minutes had passed, Wilson notched two
more goals for the Garnet. The first came off a feed from
Anthony Phalen 'lO, and the second was assisted by
Musynske. About five minutes later, Wilson stepped up
yet again, assisting Musynske in the completion of his

-Sports
with emphatic victory

hat-trick, and then recording his own hat-trick, converting on a pass from Will Predun 'O9 with about three and
half minutes to go in the third quarter.
Randolph-Macon answered back, taking advantage of a
man-up opportunity and tallying a goal before the end of
the third quarter, and they scored again with 4:51 left in
the game, but they couldn't match the Garnet offense.
Todd Friedman 'O9 sealed the deal with an unassisted
goal in the fourth quarter, putting the last point of the
game on the board and leaving the score in favor of
Swarthmore, 7-2.

Musynske attributed the launch of the Garnet offense
to their skill in the midfield and their ability to possess
and move the ball. "Our offense was sparked by the clearing abilities of our midfielders
Once we got the ball in
the offensive zone, we settled and ran the offense while
holding possession for most of the game," he said.
"We did a great job of moving off the ball and feeding
the crease, which allowed us to get some easy goals,"
Captain Frank Mazzucco 'OB said. Mazzucco also pointed
out how many times they hit the posts, and how many
more goals they may have had if they converted these
opportunities.
While the Garnet put on an offensive show, they also
more than lived up to their previously predicted defensive strength, allowing only 15 shots (only 4 in the first
half) from the Yellow Jackets, compared to their own 33
...

shots. Captain Dan Sartori 'OB attributed their defensive
success on Saturday to simple, fundamental play, saying,
"Patience was key to our defense on Saturday. We were
aggressive when we had to be but weren't over anxious to
take the ball away. It was a no frills defensive game, and
it worked well for us."
Mazzucco made five saves in the game for
Swarthmore, while Kevin Friedenberg 'lO recorded three
saves of his own while minding the net.
This impressive start is no surprise, given that three
senior captains are commanding the defensive end this
year. All-Centennial Sartori and Drew Bonessa 'OB lead
the defensive line, backed up in the net by three year
starter Mazzucco, who carries a collection of impressive
recognitions. Together, the three direct a powerful squad
that will continue to prove difficult for any opponent to
infiltrate. Friedenberg spoke highly of the senior defensemen, saying, "Our senior leadership is outstanding. Not
enough can be said about having a talented bunch of players who really know what is going on at all times."
This leadership will continue to help the Garnet as
they face their next opponent on Saturday, when they
take on the United States Merchant Marine Academy at
home on Clothier Field at 2 p.m.

Women's track comes up Men's track limps to CCCs
big at CCCs, earns silvers
BY NYIKA CORBETT

acorbetl@swarthmore.edu

BY JAYMES FAIRFAX-COLUMBO

jfairfal@swarthmore.edu

Good things come in triples: three wishes, the
Three Musketeers, the three little pigs and three
silver medals for the Swarthmore women's indoor
track and field team.
The Garnet women brought home silver
medals in the Distance Medley Relay, the 3000
meters and the 800 meters over two days at the
Centennial Conference Championships, hosted by
Ursinus College on March 1-2.
Kicking off the action was Melina Healey 'OB in
the mile. Healey ran it to a time of 5:46.38, quite an
accomplishment considering that she had done
only a week of actual running due to an injury.
The Swarthmore DMR squad, consisting of
Nyika Corbett 10, Lauren Deluca 10, Bess Ritter
'O9 and Cait Mullarkey 'O9, was next. The quartet
combined for a time of 12:4158 over 4000 meters. All
the women ran strong legs, but Mullarkey's 5:08
mile split (which would unofficially break the
Swarthmore record) propelled her ahead of a
Dickinson College runner in the final straightaway, giving the women a second-place finish by
just 15 seconds. "I had no idea how fast I was running; I was just trying to pick people off. I was
going to go for it a little earlier, but I went past
[Coach] Pete [Carroll] and he yelled, 'Slow
squeeze,' so I sat on Dickinson until we came off
the last curve," Mullarkey said, when describing
her inspired run. Mullarkey also showed some
love to her squad mates. "I did it for my teammates; they're awesome. All I could think about
was Nyika's beautiful face," she said.
Ritter was next up, rounding the track in
20:17.48 for 5000 meters. Ritter would also clock in
at 11:25.85 for 3000 meters, a remarkable feat considering thefact thatRitter raced over five miles at
the meet, all while nursing a significant fever.
Ritter wasn't the only Garnet representative in
the 3000. Corbett, Emma Stanley 'O9 and Faith
Pampel 'O9, who all ran solidly, joined her in the
race.
Stanley and Pampel both dropped considerable
chunks of time off of their results from just a week
prior, with Stanley running 11:04.86 while Pampel
ran 11:25.45, the latter mark a personal record.
The real story of the 3000, however, was
Corbett's controlled run to a silver medal. Corbett
worked her way steadily through the field until
the last few laps of the race when she unleashed a
THE PHOENIX

devastating kick to easily distance herself from the
chase pack. Her time of 10:37.71 was also good
enough to move her up to sixth place on the

Swarthmore all-time list.
In analyzing her race strategy, Corbett said, "I
was supposed to sit the first half and work the last
mile. I was happy with the race, but not satisfied."
Corbett also showed her humility, as she was
quick to change focus from herself to her teammates, as she exclaimed, "I'm looking forward to
our DMR next year. We're gonna kick some ass!"
The 800 meters was also a strong event for the
Garnet, with Deluca and Mullarkey both racing in
the fastest heat. Mullarkey started off patiently
but put in a big third lap to close the gap to frontrunner Annick Lamar of Haverford. Coming into
the final straight, Mullarkey mounted a furious
offensive, coming up just shy of Lamar in an
indoor personal record of 2:17.58, four seconds
faster than her winning time a year prior. Deluca,
struggling with a lingering illness, nonetheless
ran a respectable time of 2:3317.
Heather Hightower 'O9 was the lone Garnet
field representative, throwing the shot 8.36 meters
to set a new personal record and cap off a highly
successful rookie campaign.

"I'm looking forward to our
DMR next year. We're gonna
kick some ass!"
Nyika Corbett 'lO
Head Coach Pete Carroll was proud of the
Garnet's effort, commending the women on a job
well done. "The DMR was so exciting, last to second with a 5:08 and Bess ran an event that she
doesn't normally run and was sick and hung in
there Cait ran great, going wire to wire with an
All-American in the 800. Nyika ran a brilliant race
in the 3000 and got second because she ran smart."
Next for the Garnet women is a trip to Florida
and competition at the Florida A&M University
relays on March 7-8. "[We're] looking forward to
sunshine and no academics," Coach Carroll said.

Coach Pete Carroll described the

contingent of Swarthmore men's
indoor track team that competed in

the
Conference
Centennial
Championships this past weekend
in a few precise words: "Small
army. Big heart."
Although
the Swarthmore
plague and a variety of injuries left
the team somewhat sparse coming
into the Championship meet, a
steadfast group of men represented
their team in each of the four relay
events in addition to three individual competitions.
Connor Darby 'O9 ran a 1:59 in
the 800
dash, a time good enough
for a seventh place finish. As fellow
800 meter runner and 2008 women's
silver-medalist Caitlin Mullarky 'O9
described Darby's race, "It was a
pretty tough heat. A couple of guys
took it out fast, and Darby was
patient running controlled. So he
got caught in a bad spot." Although
many collegiate runners would be
thrilled with placing in the top ten
at a conference meet, Darby has
higher goals. "It was a disappointing day, but I know that I'm in a
good position for outdoor," he said.
Two Swarthmore seniors, Micah
Katz 'and Jonathan Shoop, represented the distance men in the 3000.
Katz had an outstanding day, running a personal record of 9:25.
When asked about his race, Katz
said, "It was pretty sweet, like a

m

-

cheetah on an African savannah."
Shoop, not impressed with his own
race, was very proud of Katz's performance and was "really happy to
be there for Mickey during the
race," as the seniors worked together through the first half of the 15
laps.
"It's always great running in the
relays, because you really feel like
you're part of a team effort," said
senior Ross "LiT Dutch" Weller who
the 4x800,4x400, and the mile
leg of the Distance Medley Relay.

Garnet loses 3-2
in season opener
BY MELIN DA PETRE
mpetrel@swarthmore.edu

On Sunday, Swarthmore baseball
lost a hard-fought season opener to
Vassar College, 3-2 in 11 innings.

VASSAR

After a long February of preseason, the team was anxious to get outside. "We've been staring at the four
walls inside the fieldhouse for the
past few weeks with very few exceptions, so to get outside and run
through our coverages and signs was
a really good thing," Ben Mendelson
'OB said.
The Garnet offense started out
strong with runs in the first and second innings. "We didn't really know
what to expect against Vassar since
they're not in our conference and
this is the first time we've played
them, at least since I've been here,"
Justin Chen 'OB said.
In the first, Thomas Nakamura 10
ran home after a Vassar throwing
error, putting the Garnet up 1-0.
The second Swarthmore run followed in the second inning, when
Kevin Kooi 'O9 belted an RBI single to
Ben
bringing
field,
left
Schneiderman 'll home. Mendelson
led the team with two hits.
Neil Mejia 'll, who was pitching
for Oak Park River Forest High
School in Illinois at this time last
year, gave Swarthmore a strong
opening day performance on the
mound, pitching for the first 5 1/3
innings. "I was so excited when I
found out I was going to be the opening day starter. I knew I was just
going to throw strikes and if they hit
the ball I felt confident my defense
would make the plays behind me,"
Mejia said after striking out nine hitters in his first game ever for the

Garnet.

"We played with more
heart on Sunday than
any other Swarthmore
baseball team has
In the past four
years, at least."
Justin Chen 'OB
Overall, it was a very impressive

and successful debut. "Mejia showed
incredible poise on the mound,"
Coach Stan Exeter said.
Vassar scored runs in the fifth
and sixth innings to tie the score 2-2,
at which point Chen took over on the
mound, helping Swarthmore thwart
Vassar's rally.

Vassar then took the lead in the
of the
11th inning, and
Swarthmore could not answer in the
bottom of the inning, sealing the
Garnet's opening day defeat, 3-2.
Ultimately, the team was hurt by
its inability to muster an effective
attack on offense. However, Exeter is
not worried because "in the first few
games of the year, usually the pitching is ahead of the hitting."
Exeter said the team was disappointed to let a winnable game slip
top

away, but added that "the overall

attitude is very positive" about the
team's effort on Sunday and
prospects moving forward.

"We've been staring at
the four walls Inside the
fieldhouse for the
past few weeks so to
get outside
was a
really good thing."
Ben Mendelson 'OB

Unfortunately, the second game in
the scheduled doubleheader was cancelled due to lack of sunlight. "It's a
shame we didn't get to the play the
second game of the doubleheader
because we would have beaten them
and a bunch of our other pivotal
freshmen [Andy Allen, James Beall
and Adam Koshkin] were all slotted
to get playing time," Chen said.
To Mendelson, the key to the
team's success lies in its pitching
staff. "If the staff can consistently do
what they did on Sunday, we'll be in
good shape," he said, noting that the
team's freshmen make up half of the
rotation and an even larger portion
of the bullpen.
The Garnet will look to "correct
our mistakes from Sunday's game
and put together a complete game,"
Chen said, as the season heats up. "I
think we will play more relaxed and
with more confidence," Mejia said.
The baseball team's next game is
today at Arcadia College at 3 p.m.
