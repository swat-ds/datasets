Students Organize Philly
Rally Against Prop. 187

The construction crew spent last month pouring the concrete foundation for the basement portion of the new
academic building in preparation for the steel structure, said Larry Schall, Associate Vice President in charge of
Facilities and Services. The floor, walls, and elevator pit of the basement have been poured. The steel structure of
the entire building should be completed by Christmas. President Al Bloom notes that the construction has
essentially not interfered at all with the normal functioning of the school. "It Is a tribute to the astute planning and
supervision by Larry Schall and Stu Hain and the efforts of the physical plant personnel that we 've been able to
stay on track on what Is a mind-boggllngly complex facilities project," Bloom said.

In response to what they call "the
tide of xenophobia" in the US,
Swarthmore students formed the
Coalition Against Xenophobia
(CAX). While their immediatefocus
is a rally at the Liberty Bell on December 10, they look towards organizing on a nationwide scale to raise
awareness about Proposition 187 and
bills of a similar nature. Their goal is
to "create a movement" against such
legislation.
The Coalition had its start after
Swarthmore's panel discussion of
Proposition 187, when roughly thirty
students created a statement ofintent
for the group and elected seven representatives to begin a consciousness-raising effort on college campuses across the country.
The Coalition Against Xenophobia thenhad its first general meeting,
at which they planned the rally and
created committees to organize various aspects of their movement. Civil
Liberties Union President Kevin
and
Keenan
'95
Mohan
Ambikaipaker '95 have contacted
students at ninety other college campuses nationwide, and rallies similar
to the one in Philadelphia are sched-

uled in Sacramento, Boston, New
York City, and Washington, DC.
In a press release to 130 media
organizations on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving break, the group
explained that it finds Proposition
187 "inhumane and counter-productive."CAX also denounced"allforms
of racism, scapegoating, and xenophobia."
"I think that is the issue,"
Ambikaipaker said. "I don't think
that illegal immigrationappeared out
of a vacuum...The whole issue came
up because we had a stratified U.S.
society voting itself a tax break and
then said, well, the underclass should
fight over what it left. I would say
economics plays a big part in that."
Most important to the students of
CAX is initiating the mobilization
process. "On the national level, our
role is to get other people going. We
don't really take care of them after
that," Keenan said. The group hopes
that the initial push will spark more
action all over the country.
Overall, the group encourages as
much participation by students as
possible. Ambikaipaker said, "This
is an historic opportunity for students
to exercise their consciences...we've
been out of it for a long time."

Students Take Part in AIDS Dance-a-thons at Swat & NYC
By Lisa Hibler

On Saturday November 26, several Swarthmore students joined in
the battle against AIDS at the annual
AIDS Dance- a-Thonheld in the Jacob
Javits Center in Manhattan. All proceeds went to Gay Men's HealthCrisis (GMHC) which provides support
services to people with HIV andAIDS
and to their care-partners, families
and friends.
A week earlier, on November 19th,
an on-campus Dance-a-Thon, organized by Sarah Cebik '95 and
Dorothea Keith-Lucas '97, involved
many more members of the College
community in the fight against AIDS.

Over four hundreddollars were raised
at thedance on campus and this money
was sent to support the GMHC.
The event was held from 9pm to
2am in the Women's Resource Center; donations to support GMHC were
requested at the door.Both coordinators were pleased with the overall
support and enthusiasmfor the event.
The night began slowly with a few
technicaldifficulties, but soon a large
crowd gathered, and donations were
generous. Over $4OO were collected.
Cebik's and Keith-Lucas' objective was to increase awareness about
AIDS, provide an oppotunity for
people to dance and enjoy themselves
and rasie money to combat AIDS.

said she wanted to "focus
people at Swarthmore on affirming
life while fighting death." She added
that the College "really came out for
this event." Many campus committees contributed to the effort: SAC
provided funding for the party so that
an entry charge was not necessary,
and CARITAS paid for food. Other
organizations sent members to help,
all of the DJ's were volunteers. Several professors also offered to donate

money to the cause.
Some of the moneyraised from the

the creative costumes of participants,
including drag queens in leopard print

Overall, participants considered

accomodate more people. One student proposed that LBGA throw a

SAC Aims to Resolve Confusion over Discount Card Distribution
By Cathy Glasheen

This fall the Social Affairs Committee (SAC)
negotiated to provide students with the Student
Advantage card, which permits holders to receive discounts on items ranging from airfare
to pizza in cities across the country. Many
students who wanted the card missed the opportunity to obtain one when cards were handed
out in Sharpies in October. Because of this,
SAC is planning another distributionfor next
week.
Alice Stillman '96, one of SAC's co-coordinators, said that SAC chose to purchase the

cards for Swarthmore students because "SAC
wants to encourage people to get off campus.
We thought that more people would go to

Philadelphia and South Street if they could use
their cards there." Co-coordinatorChris Ciunci
'95 agreed, saying, "The role of SAC is to
promote socializing both on and off campus."
Stillmanadded that the transportation discounts
would benefit everyone.
An additional factor in the decision to distribute the cards was that since no athletic
teams planned to sell discount cards this year,
SAC's offer would not undermine the
fundraisers of other campus organizations.

SAC's move to obtain the cards began last
spring when JordanTurkewitz, a vice president
Student Advantage Inc., approached Stillman
with an offer to provide all students with cards
at a bulk rate. Early this fall Stillman and
Turkewitz presented the deal to the whole committee, and the twelve members of SAC agreed
to purchase cards for the whole student body.
An individual buying the card would pay $22.
SAC agreed to the deal on these terms. Ciunci
explained "It is important that we [SAC] don't
spend people's money on things they don't
want."
For three days in October, Turkewitz and

From the Classroom to the Press: GLIM to Print Student Papers
By Amy Albert
Work has begun on the first issue of GLIM,
a new publication featuring students' work.
Almost everyone seems to have heard about it
already. The magazine staffhas made a tremendous effort in obtaining submissions.
The staffs efforts have included everything
from going from table to table at Sharpies to
talking to professors about possible paper
sources. Ultimately, the GLIM staff hopes it
has collected papers that will give readers a
glimpse into "what some people on campus are
learning," as editor Catherine Rose '97 put it.
The first issue of GLIM will be distributed
during the first weeks of the Spring semester.
Rose described the papers that the staff has

chosen by her stafffor publication as "interesting, informative, and constructed in a manner
in which theperson who is writing makes some
contribution in which we as readers get something we wouldn't
get if we read the textbook ourselves."
The publication intends to
showcaseSwarthmorestudents' j
efforts in a variety of fields. I
This gives all students the op- I
portunity to learn more about L
subjects they would not nor- \
mally study, and to share the
fruits of their labor here at
Swarthmore. Rose stated,
"There are all of these people

learning about things which surface only occasionally, in brief conversations."

GLIM will be published once a year. In
future years. Rose plans to
keep a drop box in the
mailroom so students can
submit papers to GLIM

SAC members handed out cards to bewildered
students who had no idea what the cards were
and couldn't believe they were free. SAC hoped
word would spread that the cards were available and that everyone who wanted a card
would be able to get one. Four hundred eighty
students obtained cards, but Student Council

not get a card because they did not know about

the appointment of a new treasurer
for Budget Committee, Student Council reconsidered the initial decision
of the Budget Committee. After
reinterviewing all candidates, the
Council decided to re-appoint Tanisha
Litde, who had originally been chosen for the position.
According to Darin Friess '95,
Member-at Large in Student Council, the hiring dispute stemmed from
two instances of miscommunication
in BC. First, one committee member
made a remark which others felt was
racially biased. The discussionof this
statement fore-ran the discussion of
the treasurer appointment. Some
members felt that this precluded full
discussion of the candidates' ability
and qualifications.
The second prob-

lem involved participation by Committee
members in the decision. Disagreement
existed regarding the
extent to which all
members were fully
consulted in the process. Four members of

pealed the appointment decision to
Student Council, as prescribed by
BC rules. SC, in turn, conducted full

interviews of all the candidates. In
these interviews, they examined candidates strengths and weaknesses,
interactions with, and ideas for improving, BC.
After the interviews, SC discussed
each candidate's application. "At this
'

point," says hriess, "no comparisons

between candidates were made."
Comparisons were made only after
full individual consideration of each
applicant separately. Finally, SC
members voted on each candidate.
Budget Committee continues to
work on the issues underlying the
event. According to treasurer Richard Choe '96, "BC has come to a

working agreement and should be
able to function."

Hello! I am interested in being a Member at Large on the Student Council. I
think that itis an integral position in the S warthmorecommunity and that a strong
studentvoice shouldbe heard. I will be an accessible, reliable, energetic member
who will express your views and your opinions, as well as fulfill the responsibilities of the post. I served as an active member on the student government and in
many organizations in my high school. I was the treasurer of the youth
organization. I was also editorof the school yearbook. AtSwatlamontheMovie
Committee and will be assistant treasurer ofthe StudentActivities Fund beginning
next semester. My experiences in high school and during three semesters here
have created inme an ability to listen to and respect the opinions of others, as well
as the ability to be even handed in making decisions. Most importandy, I
REALLY wantto be involved in our College community inthis way. I am excited
about this opportunity and know thatl will do a fine job. Thank You! If you have
any questions or comments, please call me at x 3915 or e-mail me at jhayounl.

council. This is an akward letter for me to writebecause while you are reading
this letter at Swarthmore, I am currently studying in Rome. I hope this transAtlantic letterproves, to some extent, how serious I am about being a part of the
Swarthmore studentcouncil. I have attended student government meetings in the
past and was impressed with what I have seen. I think I can contribute to these
discussions and provide interesting new ideas in order to make life a little more
manageable here at Swarthmore. I also participated on a committee last spring
and have developed a good understanding of how issues and problems are
debatedand ultimately resolved. I wouldbe very grateful for the chance to serve
the Swarthmore community and, most importantly, the needs of its students.
Since I will not be in attendance tovote for myself,I really must count on you to
pick up the slack. I look forward to seeing you next semester and I thank you for
your time.

Deena Bahri '98

My name is Deena Bahri and I am a first-year student interested in becoming
a memberof the College Planning Committee. This committeedeals withissues
that are very important to students. I wouldlike to be active in making decisions
about things like cclass schedules and reading periods because I think students
shouldbe represented by people with good ideas and vested interests in what
happens. Although I've never been involved in student council before, I held
several executive positions in high school. As National Honor Society president
and editor of the school newspaper, I gained experience in planning events and
agendas, as well as inmaking decisions that involved large groups of people. At
Swarthmore, I'm acurrentmemberof the Social Affairs Committee, whcihplans
social events on campus. Thank you very much for your time.

Alisha Permix '97
CRC Coordinator
My name is Alisha Pennix, class of97, and I am running for the split position
of Memberat Large and CRC Coordinator. My reasons for running are plentiful
however I will focus on t the most important. For one, I want to be active in the
Swarthmore community. I currently serve as amember ofthe Budget Committee
which allows me to directlyparticipate in the affairs ofthis campus. As a member
of Student Council I would be able to get involved while serving as a voice for
student concerns and issues. Secondly, I thinkthatl am qualified for the position.
My experiences with Budget Committee and in the theater have taught me how
to effectively work within committees and in a group atmosphere. And lastly, I
am determined and enthusiastic. I have a sincere interest in Student Council and
its functions and, ifelected, will work very hard to make sure thatStudent Council
is accessible and responsive to all students.

Ben Henwood '97
Appointments Chair
Since coming to Swarthmore College, I have gained the experience of
understanding the different needs and concerns of the Swarthmore community. I
have taken note of what some students have viewed as positive, and what others
have viewed as negative. Unfortunately, I have not been able to contribute my
observations because of a lack of opportunity. Therefore, I am running for
Appointments Chair in order to become more involved.
I consider myself an unbiased person, which is crucial when assigning
committeemembers. In high school, I held variouspositions ofleadership, which
helped me develop the ability to be responsible for representing a group, rather
than myself as an individual. Throughout my life, ithas also been stressed that
I should be open-minded to the needs of others. My life experiences lead me to
believe thatI can serve theneeds of the Swarthmore student body in an unbiased
fashion. In being a member of student council, I understandthat my duty would
beto find out and represent theneedsof the community, notmy ownneeds or those
of any one individual.
I hope, if elected, to work hard so thatSwarthmore Collegehas the appropriate
members working on specific committees. This is an opportunity for you as a
memberof a community to vote for therepresentation you deserve, and for me to
serve you as best I can.

The intense academic atmosphere
on our campus makes it difficult for
students to keep up with the issues
facing Student Council. Therefore, I
feel the burden of communicationbe-

the student body and Student
Council should be borne by the members ofStudentCouncil themselves. If
members ofStudentCouncil were able
tween

to keep students better informed about
the various topics that are being discussed, they could be more effective in

implementing policies that students

This lack of communicationhas
prompted me to run for Student CouncilMemberat Large. My goal is to get
more of the student body involved in
the activities and decisions that effect
want.

If Swarthmore is ever going to
be a true community, all of its members must be given this opportunity.
Just as communication between Student Council and the student body is
important, so is communication between Student Council and its subcommittees (i.e. Budget Committee
and S. A. C). Increasing the cooperation between Student Council and
Budget Committeeand S. A. C. would
result in activities that would be better
received by the students. Since all
three groups are dedicated to increasing the quality of life here at Swarthmore by continuing popular activities
and/or bringing events to campus, itis
important thatthesegroups try to work
them.

together more closely. I have many
close friends on all of the three committees mentionedabove, and they all seem
to complain about the same problem.
They really want to provide activities,
events, and/or clubs that students will
enjoy, but they do notknow what people
want. Unfortunately, good intentions
and large sums of money are wasted

because of the lack of communication
between the students and these three
committees and between the committees themselves. If elected Student
Council Member at Large, I will do

everything I can to keep the student
body informedof upcoming eventsand,
more importantly, possible upcoming
events.

when grades really start to count for
first-years students...can we say,
"STRESS!"? Inresponse to these new
and old complaints (I understand the
reading-period idea has already been
discussed inpast committee meetings),
I've thought about a possible solution
to the problem of not having much of
a break in the spring: Could we possibly shorten the October break by, let's
say, three days...tack one onto Thanksgiving so more people could make the
journey home, and then tack on the
remaining two to a weekend in-between winter break and the end of the

member of the class of 1998 who's
running for the position available on
the College Planning Committee for
1995.
Although the schoolyearis planned
very well, and a lot ofconsideration is
put into scheduling each year, I've
heardsome complaints among old and
new students. For instance, some are
concerned about not having any reading time for mid-terms, while others
havenoticedthat we have such a long
break in Octoberfollowed by Thanksgiving break, while we only have one

year, thus making a long weekend to
unwind a little?

I amonly a first-year student, I believe
that I could do quite well on the College

I am supportive of
upcoming sponsorships like the forums on race, and wouldlike to similar

student council not only address these
issues, butalso look at theother side of
life, i.e. social life; these two issues are
not necessarily unrelated. Student

would propose some changes in this
area. Students should receive more
time to write platforms, and I would
institute a forum between potential appointees and previous appointees to
encourage familiarity about the possible appointments. I would also like to
spread awareness of the appointments
process. I am aware that thenotices are
sent out via email, but everyone does
not check their email, and the only
other notices are the ones on the student

When You Wish Upon A Star... Stuffed and Rested
Shhhh. The American.dreamer is in R.E.M.
It will take more than eighties angst and periodic recessions to stifle theelusive American dream. First chronicled
byBenjamin Franklin, and mostrecently defiledby its association to "Dianetics," the American dreamhas plunged
through the jungle, dabbled in new ageism, and returned in its mostrecent form: neoconservatism. Last night, Star
Parker presented a small congregation of Swarthmore students with a vision of this most recent sequence of the
American dream.
Like many self-made figures before her, Mrs. Parker has been through hard times. She spent three years on
welfare, motheredfour illegitimate children by four different men, and lived in subsidized housing. One morning,
Mrs. Parker lookedinto the vortex of poverty and realized that she did not have to be dependent on the government
for existence. America meant capitalism, she realized, and that gave her liberty, the chance to strive for selfperfection, and thechance to gain affluence. In her words, "money can buy things...that is whatAmerica is allabout.
Everybody has the chance to try to make it." So she made a business, and the rest is history.
Mrs. Parker does not lie—capitalism encourages entrepreneurship, andAmerica was founded in part on theprofit
motive. If it wasn't, the NativeAmericans would still own their land and perhaps there might be more people with
funny looking beards in Pennsylvania. However, surely there is more to the American dream than indulgence in
the dollar. After all, democracy becomes an afterthought when membership in a community focuses around making
money.
There is an alternate version of the American dreamrooted more in democracy, one realized in select moments
throughout history with the Declaration of Independence, the Jacksonian Era, and the rejuvenation of activism in
the 1960'5. It is a visionof people working towards a more humane form of government—in an attempt to confront
prejudice and inequality.
Neoconservatives have missed the mark with total abandonmentof government in social services, yet technocrat
liberals are just as removed from a pursuit of humane government. As the American dream comes to fruition in the
twenty-first century, we need torededicate ourselves to thedreamof democracy. Acoming together of public policy
and activism needs to occur: otherwise, our society will run headlong into the abyss of apathy and bureaucracy.
When the Pentecostals of potential take the airways to pontificate on genetics, hard work, and apple a day
ethics,—beware, it's only part of a dream.

Homeless For One (Long) Night
By Ngina Lythcott
Like most of you, I am someone
who notices homeless people. I have
felt anger, sadness, and guilt as I
passed by, almost always unsure of
what to do. While I donate money to
feed the homeless, it's been more
than two years since I regularly volunteered at a shelter.
Before deciding to participate in
the Sleep-A-Thon, I thought about
what I hoped to gain. I hoped that
through the experience and conversations, my awareness would be deepened. For example, as I've gotten
older and busier, I've leaned more
toward community service and making donations and away from social
activism; I wanted to explore my
ambivalence about that change.I also
hoped my presence would lend support to the students exploring activism and becoming more aware of
homelessness.
Thirty-three students participated
in the Sleep-A-Thon, but when I arrived at midnight, most were already
in their tents or in their sleeping bags
on thegrass. I joined those around the
fire and listened to the lively conversation.
Despite the übiquitous smoke and
drizzle, theconversations were wonderful; somehow it didn't matter who
was a senior, a dean or a first-year
student We were all trying to share
who we were in the context of what
we were doing, as a starting point for
exploration of where we were going.
We talked about poverty in the context of other community service/social action experiences in which we
had engaged. Other students cameby
to talk with us and were invited to
stay the night
We were grateful to SHIP, the do-

nors of the PB&J sandwiches and
coffee, and to the folks in Physical
Plant who donated thewood. We also
noticed officers from Public Safety
driving by to keep an eye on us.
Although energized by the conversation, at 2:30 I needed to go to
sleep. I shook the puddles of water
offmy backpack/pillow and sleeping
bag, put my glasses in my shoes and
snuggled in. I knew even as I drifted
off that in the morning my backpack,
shoes and glasses wouldstill be there.

I finally got up at
8:30, cold and
damp, with sore
hips and a sense of
accomplishment.
Although it was extremely quiet,
upon my return from thebathroom in
the middle of the night, it was harder
to return to sleep.

The ground was
noticeably uncomfortable and my
mind was flooded with thoughts of
how it must feel to be hungry and
dispossessed. I thought about what
work I, as one person, could do to
make things better. I nodded off,
thinking about how the recent elections would likely effect the incidence and prevalence of poverty. I
recognized that I had moved away
from grass-roots organizing and had
not seen it as my responsibility to get
out the vote.
I woke up frequently after that. I
heard the garbage trucks arrive just
before 6:00; the construction workers at 7:00 and many of the hourly
workers who take care of us, soon

after that. At 7:15, the bells in Clothier Tower started ringing every 15
minutes. I finally got up at 8:30, cold
and damp, with sore hips and a sense
of accomplishment.
What did I learn? I learned that
while community service is valuable
(as are donations of money), social
action that is working to address the
causes of poverty is extremely important and that I need to do more of
it. I also learned, even as I approach
50, that I can still discipline myself to
do what I think is important. I enjoyed the challenge of living in a
community whose members explore
the idea of living their lives intentionally. And within days, as our academic community became invigorated by learning more about Proposition 187, and formed CAX, I was
reminded again ofhow very extraordinary Swarthmore students are and
how glad I am to be here among
them.

Reflections

on (burp) Thanksgiving

By Lindsay Koval
Once again, the revered yet maligned holiday season is upon us. The
recent Thanksgiving break provided
a pleasant (albeit short-lived) respite
from our daily burdens (some of them
at least) and a well-deserved interlude to the seasonal plateau which we

call winter. Abandoning the elegiac
"I want more vacation time" sentiment here, let us move on to a discussion of two key rites ofpassage of the
much hyped time span between
Thanksgiving and New Year's day:
interminable sieges of leftovers and
the burden of shopping.
Just think about the implications
of the entire Thanksgiving
tradition: this is a holi
day that centers around
the dinner table. Certainly, it is also a
time when we
should be pondering our existence and
rendering

But such apparent avarice and

Thou shalt receive a minimal perdition: get yourfriends and family holiday gifts and partake of the numerous
shopping bargains. Is shopping and
general holiday carousing a punishment? Think of combing the malls

couple of extra pounds and break the
monotony of the winter doldrums.

Candidate Platforms
College Judiciary Committee

Students can vote for three candidates. CJC acts primarily on cases that may involve
academic dishonesty.

Amy Mai Hope '97
I am level headed, good in stressful situations, and always strive to understandall sides
of the story. I have worked with friends, peers,
and professors in arbitration with both profes-

sional and personal situations. I believe
these qualities and experiences would serve
this community well if I were elected to the
College Judicial Committee.

Chris Mazingo '97
My name is Chris Mazingo '97; I am run-

ning for a position on the College Judiciary

Committee. This committee, comprised of
deans, professors, and students hears cases
involving alleged violationsof students conduct codes, academic dishonesty, and campus rules. I feel thatI am an excellent candidate for this position, and that I would be a
valuable addition to the committee.
I have had experience in both the court
system in general, and specifically, with cases
involving domesticviolence. During the past
summer, I worked as a legal intern for the
Court of Common Pleas Family Division in
Allegheny County (Pittsburgh), Pennsylvania. Most of my tasks dealt with domestic
violence cases;I worked as a direct assistant
to the Court's protection from abuse coordinator (an attorney). My main responsibility
was to obtain protective orders of court for
victims of abuse by a spouse or other family
member. Although some orders are granted
following an actual trial before a Common
Pleas Judge, approximately 96% of the cases
are resolved without a hearing. (This means
thatboth parties, abused and abuser, agree to
some settlement withouthaving an order im-

posed by a judge.) It was my duty to negotiate
some of these out of court settlements. When
parties were unrepresented by an attorney, it
was my responsibility to talk with both of
them and arrange an agreement suitable to
both parties. I had no power to order either
party to accept the settlement. I had to rely on
persuasion and negotiating skill in order to
get parties to agree to a protective order.
Moreover, I had to leave my feelings or
sympathies for eitherpersonaside in attempting to do what was best and fair for both
parties.
I believe that these skills thatI acquired in
family court would be very valuable on the
CJC. Objectivity and fairness are crucial
skills required for decision making on the
Judiciary Committee. Moreover, my knowledge of domestic abuse laws and issues could
be extremely important, as (unfortunately)
the CJC hears cases involving harassment,
stalking, orother sexual misconduct. Inshort,
I believe that I have the experience and the
intelligence necessary to decide the difficult
cases that the CJC hears. I ask you to give me
the opportunity to utilize my skills and experience by electing me to the CJC.

Franklin Rubinstein '97
I am running for one of the CJC positions
because I would like to ensure that justice is
served on the Swarthmore campus. It is very
important that just decisions are made in
regard to upholding Swarthmore's polices.
Otherwise, the school is portrayed in a negative light, and worse, people's lives may be
irreparably changed. I am active in several

activities on campus that 1 believe will help
me in serving on the CJC. I am HOLA

Amos J. Peaslee Debate Society, I participate in Chester Tutorialand intramural sports.
I have an open mind, and a firm commitment
to upholding the policies that are set forth by
the College. I believe that my experience in
debate helps me to see both sides of all
conflicts. Above all, I am genuinely concerned about the students at this school, and
wiun

u> make sure that all are treated fairly.

Thank you for you time and consideration.

Intercultural Center Intern, member of the

Phil Spector '97
My name is Phil Spector, and I am running
for a position as a member on your College
Judiciary Committee.
This platform isn't intended for those of
you who personally know me; I hope that you
already view me as trustworthy and hardworking, and most importantly that you believe I'll do the best job possible if given a
position on the Committee. For those of you
who don't know who I am, however, below is
a brief outline of what I'm all about.
I am currently a sophomore, and have taken
an active part in several Swarthmore organizations; I've participated energetically and
successfully in activities ranging from WA' ing
to Debate. I also have experience working in
our college' s student government, having now
been a member of the Budget Committee for
almost a year.
But perhaps more important than my experience is my character. I believe that I'm at
heart a man of principle; I stand for what I

believe is fair, and I make every effort to
ensure that this justice comes before selfinterest or other less substantial concerns.
I sincerely believe that I've demonstrated
this in many circumstances in the past (for
example, on BC, where objectivity is a
necessity). Furthermore, as those who
know me personally could tell you, I've
wanted to be a judge (as a career goal) for
many years now, so I believe that I'd conductmy self in a CJC position with a unique
personal drive and long-rooted desire for

In Response
to "Need for

Prop. 187"
By Brenda Ayers
I agree. Proposition 187 does signal a need
for change in California and other states who
have proposed and/or passed similar legislation. Yet the passing of such a law does not
say to me that Californians are primarily
concerned about "budget deficits and dwindling social services" and what is fair and
unfair, as Arthur Krause's article in the Nov.
18thissue says. Before California or any state
in this country tries to deal with a social
problem like immigration, people must acknowledge the extent to which racism and
xenophobia permeate practically every facet
of our social structure.
WhileKrause 's argument seemedvery logical and his use of the English language very
crafty (no doubt the result of an education
from a non-Spanish-speaking school), I find
his argument indicative of all the arguments
for Prop. 187. The arguments use one social
ill in a two-fold manner: theyrally the masses,
many of whom are uninformed people who
have never met an illegal immigrant and don't
know the legal differences between legal and
illegal immigration. At the same time, they
hide greater, more deeply-rooted societal problems-for example, racism and xenophobialie hidden behind all the propaganda. So for
those of you who say that this is an argument
about economic carrying capacity and social
fairness, I say yes it is. For those of you who
say this is an argument solely about social
fairness and economic carrying capacity, I
say you're wrong. Arthur Krause's article in
last week's issue is case in point.
While I'm sure that most people who voted
for Prop 187 will agree that "most illegal
immigrants are decent, hard-working people"
and who are truly, by their own measure,
"sympathetic to their [illegal immigrants']
plight", "one can only speculate" why many
of the same people who support Prop 187 also
support the multinational corporations,
whether directly or indirectly, who build factories on property taken from third-world

objectivity, integrity and energy necessary
for an effective and fair Judiciary Committee; one that will make every possible effort to make the right decision in all possible circumstances.
Thank you for your time and consideration.

this position has depended on me to work
with others to make the best decisions
possible for the benefitof the larger community. I come now asking for your
support to be elected to the College Judicial Committee. I feel that I will be able
to help the committee (which is made up
of deans, faculty members AND students)
reach fair and just decisions regarding any
circumstance that thecommitteewouldbe
presented with. I have the ability to be
impartial, which I have demonstrated as a
member of both the Budget committee
and the Appointments Committee. I fully
realize that a position on this committeeis
a large commitment and responsibility,
but it is one that I feel that I can both
handle and perform with efficiency and
professionalism. I thank you for your time
and I hope thatI can have your support as
well.

ity. I thinkthat whenCalifornian business owners
send messages of prosperity in soliciting illegal
labor, they should also explain that it is not the
illegal immigrant who prospers in most cases but
the man (or woman because "women voted for
Prop 187...and have political voice too 1") who
owns the fields, the business, or the house that
prospers. Again one can only speculate "how
many of these people may one day try to break our
laws and then receive government aid" (as if one
act entailed the other), if they knew that they
would be no more free in California, the home of
Rodney King, than they were in their respective
lands. Oh, but isn't that whatProp 187 is trying to
tell them? This is California's proposition to the
illegal immigrant: jVengan! jPor favor, vengan!
Queremos su laborpero no los queremos a Ustedes.
No son ciudadanos de nuestro pais. Nunca lo
seran. No son dignos de nuestro tiempo, de
nuestros servicios, de nuestras medicinas, y de
nuestro dinero, el dinero que nos ayudan a crear.
;No obstante, vengan! jPor favor, vengan... ! 2
Once again, I disagree: Some "schools are so
heavily Spanish-speaking that others cannot get
a decent education." Who has truly gotten a
decent education who cannot respect differences
and learn about his surroundings? 'lndeed, s/he
who is surrounded by such abundant resources
and yet refuses to partake of such good fortune
is truly the most uneducated of people'Brenda's Little Book of PC Proverbs, Vol. 3.
In conclusion, Krause has some valid assertions, mainly that illegal immigration is a serious
problem, not justfor California butfor the country
as a whole. However, forme, those few assertions
with which I do agree are whited-out (no pun
intended) by the many xenophobic, subtly racist
remarks which he makes. Nevertheless, Krause's
remarks are understandable because they are in
defense of a xenophobic, not-so-subtly racist law.
One can only speculate what type of society would
pass such a law.

John Todd '97
Hello. My name is John Todd and I am
running for a position on the College Judicial
Committee. I realize that this position entails
both dedicationand good judgment and I feel
that I have both qualities. During the year
past (my freshman year) I served as a member
of the Budget Committee. During my time on
the committee, I was in the position to make
decisions concerning allocations of school
money to the various groups that make up
Swarthmore College. Being that this is a
committee, I had to work with others to
achieve both consensus and fair allocations.
My time on the committee also made me
realize how important level thinking and fair
judgments are to the well-being of the entire
campus. Since the beginning of this school
year, I have served on the Student Council as
the CRC Coordinator and as a member of the
Appointment Committee that appoints the
various members of groups such as Budget
Committee, SAC and RA Selection. Again,

large and some weak numbers.
The show opened with the odd band Fatimah
Mansions (surprisingly +Live+ used to open for
this group). The members of Fatimah Mansions

seemed to revel in theridiculous as both their two
guitarists and their bassists wore dresses. The lead
singer made some political statements about Jesse
Helms which were in poor taste (terrible HIV
jokes) between really silly songs. Their set ended
with three guys in masks running onto stage and
playing trombones and trumpets (Hello?!?!).
During most of their set, the guys behind me were
saying, "These guys are on acid!" That was a flattering assesment, since most others just said,
"These guys suck!" I agree with both.
Next up was Weezer, known mainly for their
"Sweater Song" (a YlOO and DRE favorite).
Many fans seemed to be in the house as the moshing was intense to their decent, but not tremendously exciting set. But the cheese started piling
up when the bassist yelled, "C'mon Philly, make
some noise!" Please, I wanted to see Weezer, not
AC/DC (no disrepect to fans of the singers of the
beautiful and meaningful song, "Highway to
Hell"). That was just the first of a long line of
dumb comments by the bassist ("Shout, people,
this is the home of Rocky Balboa!"). The music
was 0.K., but nothing original at all, just the same
old grunge stick.
After a wait of forty-five minutes, +Live+ took
the stage and opened with their hit "Selling The
Drama." The rest of their set consisted of songs
taken primarily from their second album,
"Throwing Copper," with only three from their
debut, "Mental Jewelry." The sound was terrific
and singer Ed Kowalczyk, especially, was in top
form. The weakest moments undoubtedly consisted of the band's unmemorable songs, 'Top," "All
Over You,""lris," and "Stage," which seemed

more than excuses to mosh (the crowd
eagerly complied). It was songs like these which

less original on album number two, but at least

they stopped the cheesy "let's all love one another and stop the destruction" lyrics of the first
album.
Yet the band, particularly Kowalczyk, invested
so much emotion

into their best songs, "Lightning

Crashes," "Pillar of Davidson," "Beauty of Gray,"
"I Alone," and a few others, that much of their set
was exhilarating to behold. The greatest moment
of the show came when the Kowalczyk grabbed
an acoustic guitar and performed a song written by
a friend of his called, "Supernatural." This was
the rawest and most beautiful song.

Unfortunately, people started to clap along, which
they did with all the quite songs. Is it just me, or
doPhilly residents have no rhythm? I'm surprised
that all the off-beat clapping didn't throw the band

off.
Kowalczyk mentioned between songs that
+Live+ performed at the Theater of Living Arts a
couple months earlier. I would have much preferred to see this terrific band in that small club
rather than in the Tower's monstrous confines.
I'm a little bit biased in that I always like small
clubs, but the Tower was just ridiculously big
(which means I had to put up with that many more
flannel-wearing, baggy pants-wearing twelveyear-olds trying to be alternative). Besides that,
the workers at the Tower are a bitblind: there was
no smoking in the theater, but just one step into
the bathroom was like a dream sequence from a
bad movie...smoke everywhere.
Overall, it was definitely a fun night. +Live+
put a lot ofemotion into their set so I forgot about
their weaker songs.
The first two
bands....well...the first two bands were entertaining in that I could laugh at them. The fans of
+Live+ were obviously pleased, from all the
remarks I heard on the way out. On the other
hand, if you were thinking (I doubt it) of buying

that new Fatimah Mansions album you will be
throwing away money which could buy two
Pizzas!

Remembrances of Thanksgiving
Vent by

Katie

Menzer

I thought in my
Thanksgiving
free time
I wouldwrite this
week's columnin
myme
I've not done this
before
So if its a bore
Please keep my virginity in mind

But the style is not just the key
I must decide what my topic should be
I could talk of vacations
Or the elections or Haitians
But instead I'll discuss the turkey
The turkey just ain't a smart bird
As I'm sure all you Swatties have heard
So the fact that we heat 'em
And then try to eat 'em
Seems to me quite absurd
But please give me grace now to tell
Of the case history we all know so well
When the dumb bird feels pain
From droplets of rain
In this world it's not destined to dwell

So the fact we give many an hour
To sit around and devour

A bird of such limited brain
That it will stand and drown in the rain
Gives this fowl too much power
I advocate a change of the guard
A revolution would not be too hard
Something vegetarian
Without fowl or carrion
And perhaps just a smidgen of lard

(And of this I would surely not lie)

M

And let the rain go down its throat
As if dunked in an ocean or moat
And there soon the creature will die

Star Trek: Generations
The latest installment in the Trek series of films is out now. It's called Star Trek.
Generations and it stars the cast of thehit television show, Star Trek, The Next Generation.
However, it also showcases some holdovers from the original Trek shows, namely
William Shatner, Walter Koenig, and James Doohan. These old faces provide a segue for
the new series into thebox officerealm that theold series already conquered.
The film, which centers around a temporalphenomenon called the Nexus, opens with
a scene from Trek history; a new Enterprise encounters the Nexus on its maiden voyage
CaptainKirk gets stuck in the Nexus which is a place where time has no meaning and a]
of aperson's dreams can come true. We then flash to 78 years later, when the film takes
place. Malcolm McDowell plays Dr. Soran, a man who was ripped from the Nexus by
the mission in whichKirk was caught and was presumed dead.Capt Picard, the present
Enterprise Captain, then gets stuck in the Nexus while trying to stop Soranfrom destroy
ing a solar system to get back into the Nexus. Picard then finds Kirk and convinces him

to

investigate

Hudsucker's mysterious new "idea
man", and wouldn't you know it, she
ends up falling for the big sap. Leigh's
hyperstylized take on Rosalind Russel's
performance in His Girl Friday is a brilliant bit of deadpan lunacy; she deserves
an Oscar for hand gestures alone. Also
notable are Paul Newman as the scheming, cigar-chomping Sidney J.
Mussburger, and Bruce Campbell (The
Evil Dead) as Smitty, one of those wisecracking, hanging-around-the-newsroom
guys.
Unlike Sleepless in Seattle, which
slavishly imitates old movies even as it
pretends to be smarter than than,
Hudsucker is more of a reinterpretation
than a remake. The Coens have borrowed
the story, but the sensibility is wholly thenown Unlike the screwball comedies it
honors, the world of Hudsucker is wholly artificial; even the cityscape is an elaborate model Like other movies about
movies, Hudsucker explores the myths
America has told itself, in all their absurdity and effectiveness. Sure, it's a bit formal, more reliant on panache than on
character development, but so was
CitizenKane. It could be self-indulgent
and impersonal, but Robbins' Norville
radiates enough good-natured warmth to
keep the film moving through its drier
spots.

Although The Hudsucker Proxy doesn't have the profundity or insight of the
Coen's best work. Barton Fink, it's too
much fun for this to bother me much.
There's an attempt at some complex
symbolism involving circles, watches,
and two mysterious figures who seem to
live in a clock tower, but when
Hudsucker is at its farcical best, it's moving too fast to stop and think. Sadly, the
film was a sizable flop, earning areturn of
less thanhalf of its substantialbudget, and
so it may be a while before the Coen
brothers are again given enough money
to create as seamless a vision as the
Hudsucker Proxy.

Sports
Rugby Plays Sevens Tournament
By Jennifer Philpott

Both of Swarthmore's Rugby
in the 36th Annual New
York Sevens RugbyTournamentheld
in Central Park and Randalls Island
on Saturday, November 26.
The game of Sevens is a different
version of rugby than most spectators are accustomed to seeing, and
differentthan most of Swat's ruggers
are used to playing. The halves are
seven minutes long with a one minute
half-time and there are only seven
players on each team, as opposed to
the standard 15. The game is mainly
focused on theback line, which makes
it a passing, running, tackling, and
strategy-oriented game with a very
fast pace. There is some kicking, but
running and passing are more common. Sevens is very often more highscoring than regular, fifteen-man
rugby. The rules are the same and a
referee officiates.
The women's team was composed
ofNicole Jassie '95, Katie Laird '96,
Bridget Arbour '97 (all of whom had
played in previous years), Anita
Pedraza '96, Kelly Shannon'96, Lynn
teams played

Matthews '97, Daniella Learner '96,
and Jen Philpott '97. The Gotham
City team, a club team based in New
York City, took them somewhat by
surprise and defeated them soundly.
However, after an hour's rest, Swat
came back with a plan against Ottawa Scottish and scored two tries to
finish with a final score of 10-17.
Matthews scored an outstanding try
after intercepting a pass and Pedraza
scored following an intense try-line
standthat the team was finally able to
convert to five points.

While Swarthmore's women
ruggers were certainly not in contention for the finals of the tournament,

they played hard, had a good time,
and sold a few t-shirts, although there
are still more for sale. Interestingly,
the Philadelphia Women's Rugby
Club won the final round of the tournament.

The men's team, composed of Justin McLean '95, Mike Madden '95,
Darin Friess '95, Ricky Phillips '96,
Chris Marin '96, Chas Teplin '96,
and a wrestler, Tirian Mink '9B,
played both ofits games on Randalls
Island insteadofCentral Park against

two very tough teams.

The first game
was against McGill University, a team
from Montreal. The Canadian ruggers
have a distinct advantage because
they begin playing at a much younger
age than Americans—not having
football makes a difference. McGill
was a force to be reckoned with and
S warthmorenever really had a chance
against them. The second game was
against the lona Collegeruggers, who
barely lost to McGill in a previous
round. Despite that fact, Swarthmore
fought hard and played an intense 14
minutes of rugby. McLean scored
Swat's try. The final score was a
respectable 24-7.

Both Swat teams were at a disadplaying against teams who
actually play Sevens regularly and
who practice year round. However,
neither team went with the goal of
winning and they got the pleasure of
watching, and, in the men's case,
playing against, some world-class
ruggers. The level of play was very
high and some of the teams were
amazing to watch. All in all, an
vantage,

impressive tournament.

Students Isolated From Outside Women's Basketball
Opens Season In
Tip-Off Tournamnet

By Charity Miller

Week 13of the NFL season passed
on Sunday with some teams breezing
towards theplayoffs and other teams
wheeling back to the locker room.
As a western Pennsylvania resident
living 25 minutes southofPittsburgh,

a long-time Steelers fan. However, something strange has happened
to my football habits since arriving
here at Swarthmore.
I was one of those hopeless fans

I'm

who would sit in front of the TV
every Sunday, and of course on the
Monday night whenmy favorite team
graced national television. I noticed

this Sunday though, as I fought with
the, TV in the basement for decent
reception, that I have no clue as to
how my team has been doing; I've
been shamefully neglecting my
Steeler pride.
Ever feel like
Swarthmore really isn't part of the
outside world? Any place that can
wean me from football must have

some kind of power.
As for the Steelers, I was pleasantly surprised by their win on Sunday by a score of 21-3 over the Los

Angeles Raiders. I was even happier
as
at

I realized their record now stands
9-3 as they contend for first place

in the AFC Central division with their

biggest rival, the Cleveland Browns.
The win was the fourth straight and
seventh in eight games for the
Steelers. Pittsburgh has allowed just
85 points in its last eight games after
yielding 87 in its opening four. The
team leads the NFL in sacks and the
offense has been playing well despite
the injury of Neil O'Donnell. Mike
Tomczak stepped in and threw tow
touchdown passes to lead the victory
over the Raiders.
So, I am now caught up on my
team after a little investigating in
McCabe, but I will never forgive
Swarthmore for disturbing my loyalty, even if for only 13 weeks.

SCUBA CLASSES AT SWARTHMORE COLLEGE

way we're supposed to play, the way

By Dan Malkoun

we play

The Swarthmore Women's Basketball team started off the winter
season with a 1-3 record, but many
team members will contend that they
are playing better than their record
reflects. The Garnet women fell to

Cabrini College in the first round of
the Tip-Off Tournament, held at the
College of Notre Dame, but rebounded in the consolation game
beating Neuman College and finishing third overall. Since the win against
Neuman, however, the Garnet have
dropped two straight at home to conference foes Western Maryland and
Dickinson.
While the recent skid may be some

cause for concern, sophomore forward Lisl Cochran-Bond feels the
team is building from those losses
and solidifying their play. About the
loss to Western Maryland, CochranBond quipped that the women "just
zoned out and did nothing" for most
of the game, but claimed that

Maryland may have come a little too
late, the Tide came out strong against

the Dickinson Red Raiders, who are
ranked 11th in the nation. Though
the margin of defeat was ten points,
68-58, Dickinson hit four foul shots
in the closing minute to ice what was
otherwise a very tight game. CochranBond, watching with a more critical
eye as she sat out this game due to a
case of the flu, was highly enthusiastic about her team's play despite the
loss: "We finally started playing the

in practice. In practice we
always play tough defense and have
a high level of intensity and strength,

but for some reason we had been
playing down a level in the games."
This time, however, the Swat women
came out strong and finished strong.
Despite being down 12-2 in the early
going, the defense stepped up, allowing the offense to finally get in sync;

soon the game was tied at 14-14.
Swarthmore trailed by three at halftime and came out strong in the second half, remaining neck and neck
with Dickinson until the end.
So far this season, Nancy
Rosenbaum '96 and Heather Maloney
'95 have played very consistently at
forward and point guard respectively.
Freshman Michele Walsh has come
in off the bench to spark the offense,
knocking down three treys in the

Dickinson game. Other stand-outs
include sophomores Pia Houseal,
who's been playing tenacious "D"
and crashing the offensive and defensive glass to collect rebounds, and
Leslie Hermsdorf, who is back from
an injury suffered last year adding
some slick passing to the Garnet attack.

With a bit more confidence the
women's team hopes to continue its
inspired play and looks to pick up
some wins in the Seven Sisters' tournament this weekend. They face
Smith College of Massachusetts in
their opening game Friday evening.
After that, the team returns home to
close out the pre-holiday portion of
their schedule with a game against

arch rival Haverford on December
7th at 6:00, in Clothier Pavilion.

Men's Basketball Evens Conference Record at Dickinson
By David Lischer

The Swarthmore's Men's Basketball team
evened its Centennial Conference record at 11 (2-3 overall) with an impressive 57-54 win at
Dickinson College on Wednesday night. The
win came on the heels of a three game losing
streak. Forward Kirk Daulerio '95 led the team
with 21 points and 11 rebounds. Center Aaron
Bond '97 contributed 11 points, six rebounds
and a blocked shot.
The Garnet started the season with a strong
performance in the Equinox Classic which included a dramatic 80-79 victory over Connecticut College and a near defeat of Kenyon College, ranked third in Division HI. The Garnet's
only two returning starters lifted the team to
victory against ConnecticutCollege. Daulerio,
despite a poor shooting night, led the team with
20 points and 11 rebounds while guard Jay
Rose '95 scored 19 points and added four
assists.
The Garnet dominatedConnecticut College
both on defense and in rebounding, swiping an
incredible 26 offensive rebounds. Guard/forwardBen Schall '97 led the defense with four
steals, while guard Colin Convey '97 and center Sam Voolich '96 had three steals a piece.
While the Garnet was able to match Kenyon
in rebounding, Kenyon's defense was overwhelming and held the Garnetto 40% shooting
from the field. The Garnet was able to stay in
the gamethrough excellent free throw shooting
by guard Craig Rodner '96, Schall, andDaulerio.

Swimming
Makes A
Big Splash
By Joe Hackel and Karsten Scherer-Nadal
Due to the nature of the swim season, the
swim team has enjoyed two and a half meets in
the last week. The Bryn Mawr meet took place
on Wednesday and was a win for the women.

The remainder of the team, including the
women, participated in two meets at Kutztown
and Widener.
At the Kutztown meet, the team did not
perform as well as expected as Swarthmore
was vaguely disturbed by its shortcomings.
The women's team soundly defeated the
"Women of Kutztown," winning by the score
of 112-93. The women captured the lead early
on and never fell behind. Exceptional performances were had by many a woman swimmer
on this day. A few women were ushered into
the realm of the 1000 free for the first time,
namely Jessica Keith '96 and Ariel Behr '9B.
Molly Marino '9B, went a solid 5:35 in the 500
Free and Skye Fulkerson '96 pulled an outstanding 1:12 in the 100 breast.
The men didn't fare as well, falling to
Kutztown. The meet began on a strong note.
The four swimmers in the 400 medley relay,
Greg Hamilton '95, Kendrew Witt '96, Justin
Herring '97, and Carl Sanders '9B won with a
time of 3:54. Sanders did extremely well,
winning all ofhis events. Mark Friedberg '9B,
much to the chagrin of the rest of the team, had
to get back for wind ensemble, turned in a
respectable 500 free and Doug McCrath '97
didwell in the 200 breast. The meet came down
to the final relay. Unexpectedly, Kutztown had
some talent to spare.
At their next meet three days later, the team
fared better, facing a Widener team missing a
couple of swimmers due to unspeakable circumstances. The women defeatedthe Widener
Ducks by a score of 119to 86. Alice Unger '9B
swam a very nice 2:04 in the 200m. Amber
Halsey '9B fought her way through a solid 200
IM. Tricia Duncan '95 astounded one and all
with what may have been the smoothest backstroke in the meet. Kim Killeen '97 continues
to show improvement in the 200 Breast.
The men's team defeated Widener soundly,
161 to 43. Greg Hamilton '95, swimming the
1000 free, made the conference cut-off time
early in the season. Carl Sanders '9B missed the
pool record by about a second in the 200 free;
Jaime Raich '97 finished not far behind. Matt
Cohen '95 swam a good 500 free with a 5:28,
and Ben Lyons '95 again proved himself a
skilled breast stroker.
Swarthmore swims against F&M this coming Saturday at 2:00 pm at Ware Pool.

points, three rebounds, three assists, and only
one turnover
Facing an eight point half-time deficit, the
Garnet matched Kenyon basket for basket and
eventually narrowed the lead to four with just
over two minutes remaining. Kenyon, however, didn't lose its composure facing the
Garnet'spressure defense and made its critical
free throws. Kenyon finished the game a remarkable 15-16 from the line.
This season, the Garnet face one of the most
difficultschedules of any Division 111 team. In
addition to third-ranked Kenyon, the Garnet
Marshall,
will face number one Franklin
defending champion Lebanon Valley, and two
Division I opponents, Lafayette and Yale. Although the in-conference F&M game is the
only one to have a direct effect on the Garnet's
playoff hopes, the quality of these opponents
has the potential to be very intimidating.
"I think it's really good for us to play against
teams that are another levelup. I am pleased we
don't play teams just to pad our record," said
forward Mark Pletcher '96. Rodner sees the
difficult first third of the season as excellent
preparation for the conference schedule, the
bulk of which is played after Winter Break.
After the tough Kenyon loss, Swarthmore
dropped its first conference game in a highscoring, fast-paced battle with Western Maryland 93-85. Daulerio had a career night tying a
conference record for points (34) and setting a
new conference record of 14 field goals. He
shot an amazing 78% from the field and 56%
from behind the three-point line in a performance that helped earn him a spot on the
Centennial Conference Honor Role. Daulerio
was not the only record-breaker. Schall also
had a career-high seven assists.
Unfortunately, Daulerio was knocked out of
the game with six minutes remaining. The
Garnet had run a man-to-man defense most of
the game but were unable to stop Western
Maryland's outside shooters who shot 46%
from the three-point line. Voolich scored 10
and added eightrebounds. Convey had another
well-rounded game with four assists and nine
points on 50% shooting from the field.

his most solid performance of the year with
nine points, five rebounds, five assist, and three
steals. "Everyone has confidence going 12
players deep," co-captain Rodner said.
The Dickinson win propels the team into this
weekend's Lopata Classic at Washington Uni-

versity in St. Louis. There the Garnetmay face
Washington, Pomona-Pitzer, and Colorado

Colleges. In their final game before the holidays this Wednesday at 7:00,.the Garnet hosts
Haverford College in one of the most anticipated and emotional games every season.

The Garnet's performance against such tough
opponents as Kenyon and Lafayette, to whom
they lost 87-62, is very encouraging. Despite
the loss, the Lafayette game showed that the
Garnet's strength lies in their depth. Bond was
the only starter to have a strong performance,
shooting 5-9 from the field and 7-8 from the

line for 17 points.
However, Voolich and guard Jim Foley '95
made outstanding contributions off the bench.

The Eagles' Losing Effort
By Dan Malkoun

generally smaller than when the Eagles face a

The Philadelphia Eagles have fallen on some
hard times of late, dropping three games in a
row and stumbling out of the playoff picture.
The blame for theBirds' recent ugly play has
been thrown in every direction, thoughmainly
to head coach Richie Kotite and quarterback
Randall Cunningham.While the incensed fans
of the City of Brotherly Love calling for owner
Jeffrey Lurie to put the heads of Cunningham
and Kotite on spikes atop the Vet as a reminder
to future Eagle coaches and quarterbacks, I
think that a less drastic course ofaction might
be more plausible and a bit less gory.
The criticisms of both the coach and his QB
are not by any means unfounded. To Kotite's
discredit, in the last three games the Eagles
have come out flatter than and old bottle of
soda, and the game plan has been anything but
adequate on both sides of the ball. He has also
failed to draft the talent necessary to maintain
a winning football team. The play calling has
been atrocious, and time and again Kotite resorts to conservative decisions in crunch time
that end up losing games. In his defense, the
team's execution of his plays hasn't been perfect, and he really doesn't have the final word
in drafting talent. Regardless, the Eagles will
probably never be a great team when Kotite's
behind the wheel.
Cunningham has definitely got to take much
of the blame, since he hasn't thrown a touchdown pass in over 100 attempts in the past three
games. His passes have gone everywhere but to
his intended receivers, sailing balls when he
should be zipping them in. But despite all these
problems, the "800 Birds" of Philly shouldn't
be calling for Cunningham's head, simply because thelosses aren't allhis fault. Cunningham
is still one of the most dangerous offensive
weapons in theentire league, no matter what he
has done in the last three games. He still has
tremendous speed for a quarterback, he is the
master of thebroken play, and he can stillair it
out the length of the field and hit receivers, as
he's shown many times this season.
The firstproblem is the offensive line. While
Cunningham's passes have been way off the
mark this season, when you really sit down and
watchthe man, yourealize that healmost never
has any time to throw the ball. Against the
worst defenses, like Atlanta's, Cunningham
was sacked five times, a number which is

good defense like that of Arizona. The offen-

Cunningham's face, and die rash of holding
penalties they've accrued is proof enough that
they are struggling to protect the passer. Rarely
do you ever see Cunningham throwing the ball
from the pocket, a fact which has drawn him
much criticism over the years, but a fact which
is also not his fault. It seems like t least ninety
percent of the time that Cunningham drops
back to pass he is either sacked, hurried, or
chased out of the pocket and forced to throw
wildly or scramble for some extra yards. The
other ten percent of the pass plays, when
Cunningham does get some time, he is erratic
to say the least, but who can blame him? He's
obviously rattled by the pass rush that just
keeps getting to him and knocking him down
play after play.
Furthermore,
the Eagles during
Cunningham's tenure have never, with thebrief
exception of three games this year, had a significant, threatening running game. In the
game against San Francisco when Charlie Garner rushed for over one hundred yards and
scored twice, Cunningham lookedlike the most
prolific passer in the league, and far outplayed
his opponent Steve Young. This flash of brilliance was not without reason, since a legitimate running game is a proven method of
relieving pressure from the quarterback.
Cunningham has never had a good running
back to divert the defense's attention, and thus
the other team can always bring everybody at
him, running stunts, blitzing linebackers, and
just plain pinning back their ears and going
after the passer. Backs like Emmitt Smith,
Thurman Thomas, and Barry Foster can punish
blitzing teams by hitting the hole and getting
into the vacant secondary to pick up huge
chunks of yardage. Playing the Eagles is a
different story, though, since teams can sit on
thepass on secondand third downs because the
Eagles are always going to pass, guys like
James Joseph, Vaughn Hebron, Heath Sherman,
and Hershel Walker, regardless of their other
abilities, will never present the same kind of
threat to a defense that Smith, Foster, and
Thomas do. Faced with such adversity,
Cunningham never has time and never has the
element of surprise, even on play action passes,
since no defense bites because they all know
that the Eagles can't run the ball. The only

relief that Cunningham gets is of his own doing, since teams have to guard against him, not
the running backs, running the ball.
Likewise, Cunninghamis criticized for never
throwing over the middle, never checking off
his receivers, and never reading the defense.
He hasn't had a healthy, dangerous tight end to
go over the middle since the days of Keith
Jackson and Keith Byars. In addition, he never
has time to check off his receivers or to make
any adjustments to the defense because he is
constantly under the fire breathing mouths of
Eric Swarms and Charles Haleys who are waiting to eat his body for dinner on every play and
who usually get to him on every play.
All these factors have, in my opinion, combined to produce a quarterback who has, after
continual beatings and two season-ending inju-

ries, become shaken, anxious and rattled. The
answer to the Eagles' woes is not to go out and
hire a Steve Young or a Troy Aikman. Such
quarterbacks like these two would definitely
hit those much neededpasses that Cunningham
has been recently missing, but neither Aikman
nor Young would survive for long without a
running game, a tight end, and an offensive line
that actually protects the passer. The answer to
the Eagles troubles is the same as it was ten
years ago: build a good offensive line, get a
good tight end, and draft a running back who
can carry the ball twenty to thirty times a game
on a consistent basis. Until the head coachand
the front office get together to address these
problems, the Eagles will never makeit past the
second round of the playoffs, if they're lucky
enough to even make the playoffs.
