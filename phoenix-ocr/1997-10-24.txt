Seven players of the football team decided to throw in the towel, after the coach
issued an exhortation to the team on Monday.
At this Monday's practice, head football
coach Karl Miran "invited" those players
who had lost their interest in playing to
leave the team. "I said that I was tired of
coaching a team that had so little heart in
the way they played and that anyone who
knew their heart wasn't in it anymore had
my blessing to leave," remarked Miran.
The team has suffered six straight losses
since the beginning of the season, following a winless season last year.
In coming to his decision which he
thought would offer an out to players were
already contemplating the idea of leaving,
according to Miran, he had to balance his
desire to reinvigorate a somewhat disillusioned team and the fear that too many
players would leave. In the end, the former
prevailed. Miran said he felt the lack of
spirit on the part of some players threatened to drag down upbeat players around
them. He claims he does not regret the
move. "If that winds up hurting the program, I'm willing to be judged on that in
the future, remarked Miran, "but given
the way things were going, this gives us a
fighting chance to make it better."
Seven players did take Miran up on his
offer. Lou Basenese 'OO, Charlie
Parlapanides '99, Jon Riess 'OO, Tony
Sciatis '99, and Alejandro Sierra 'OO, all
starting players, as well as Matt Newcomer
'99 and Jaspal Singh 'Ol, will not be returning to the field. The team now has approximately thiry players left. A minimum
of twenty players are required to field a

team.

Responses to the mass departure of players varied, but a general feeling ofoptimism
still persists amongst the remaining team

members. Many feel that it served the purpose of filtering the team down to its essence. "The people staying on the team are
here because they love to play football,"
said Mike Hopper, referring to Tuesday's
"motivated, focused" practice as an example of how the team was better off without those who left. The positive attitude
of the players also makes leadership a lot
easier, said Ben Hall '9B, co-captain of the
team. Miran hopes the rest of the team will
take advantage of this forward-looking
momentum: "This is an attitude we can
build on. If anyone can make something
good come out of this, it'll be these guys
who stayed."
Many players found their personal loyalties conflicting with their sense of loyalty to the team. "They [the players who
left] are some of my best friends," remarked
Ford O-Connell 'OO, "It was their own decision, but it wasn't right." "You don't jump
off a sinking trip for the lifeboats and leave
the rest of the crew," O'Connell continued,
"It revealed a lot about the mental toughness and competitive edge of some people
on the team."
One of the former players who spoke on
the condition of anonymity defended his
decision, citing the team's poor score
record. I could understand [O'Connell's
reasoning] if we were even half way competitive, but we were losing by fifty points
every game."
The players' reasons for leaving the team
were personal, according to many of their
friends, but one overriding reason behind
decision suggested by many of the remaining players is their dissatisfaction with
Miran's poor coaching. "The coach is the
namedreason," explained Tucker Zengerle
'OO, "they say the losing sucks but they hold
him responsible for it. That's what they
say; that's not what reality is." Players' disappointment with Miran, whichdid not find
resonance amongst those who remain on
the team, stems from his "weak motiva-

Women's Volleyball back after turbulent start
Min Lee

It was a bittersweet homecoming for women's volleyball on
Wednesday night. After nearly
two months on the road, a team
plagued by tiredness and injury
returned buoyant to a gleaming
new wooden floor and an equally
impeccable cheering squad in
Tarble Pavilion for their first
home game of the season against
Washington College.
But it was a hard-earned and
well-deserved reward. Due to
renovations on the floor, the team
was forced to practice at a nearby
healthplex at 5 in the morning
every day for nearly the entire
season. They only resumed normal practice hours this Monday
after the floor was completed.
The Phoenix published an in-

vestigative report on the situation
of the team in its 9/19 issue. It
was suspected that the renovations had been put off until the
beginning of the semester due to
the College's prior committments
to summer athletic camps. The
administration maintains that the
lateness was due to the fact that
the Board of Managers had approved the project only in late
May.
The game against Washington
yielded a modest but sympathetic
and vociferous crowd including
a small contingent of "stompers,"
whose thundering footsteps
rocked the bleachers throughout
the night. Kevin Schlottmann 'OO,
a member of the "stomping
squad", played NBA-like
showtunes on his trumpet to
complement the never-ending
chants and cheering.

This Saturday, October 25th,
African-American women from
all over the United States will
gather at the Benjamin Franklin
Parkway in Philadelphia for the
Million Woman March. Organized by women of African descent who work at the grassroots
level, the march is intended to promote stronger bonds among black
women in America. Swarthmore
College will send its own contingent to the march, with sophoKia

are working
with students
from a number
of other schools
to help bring as many women to
Philadelphia as possible, and there
will be approximately one hundred visitors staying
at
Swarthmore this weekend for the
landmark event. "One reason why
I think this march is very important is that black people are, to me,
right now, at a very critical point,"
says Stokely-White. "When you
have a lot of black single parents
and all this disruption, all this confusion... There's going to be a lot
of positive energy at the march.
People who felt they didn't have
any skills are going to leave filled
with inspiration."

Among others speaking at the
Million Woman March will be
Winnie Mandela, Congresswoman Maxine Waters (D-California), and Helen Wright,
daughter of author Richard
Wright. The National Organizing Committee for the March is
also planning to discuss various
platforms including the ClA's
role in the influx of drugs inAfrican-American communities,
the education of black women
and youths, health facilities, human rights violations ofAfricans
in the Americas, elderly

did before with teams a whole lot more
successful. This may not be the style they
were used to in high school, but it's the style
that has been successful here at other
times."
Many players see the recent setback as
part of a larger trend oflimited support and

A queer-straight alliance has been
formed by Talia Young 'Ol and Justin Suh
'OO, welcoming people of all sexual orientations. The group will be the first of
its kind at Swarthmore. The alliance was
inspired by interest shown by queerfriendly freshmen who were turned away
by the queer-only policy of the
Swarthmore Queer Union (SQU).
The primary focus of the queer-straight
alliance is to raise awareness on campus
about queer issues and to open up discussion about gender-role transgression and
complex sexual identities. Both Suh and
Young believe that the Swarthmore community has been exceptionally queerfriendly, but not completely discrimination-free. "We have encountered ho-

mophobia, and trans-gender-phobia, some
subtle, and some very unsubtle, and I guess
we'd be trying to address that, through
education, or awareness or discussions,"
says Young.
SQU has been working with the Admissions Office and the Dean's Office to include a question on the roommate
questionaire asking whether the student is
either comfortable having a queer roommate or whether (s)he would like to request
to have a queer-friendly roommate. Young
and Suh say that the adminsitration has
been very cooperative, especially at the
admissions level. They hope that the new
alliance will give them more leverage
when proposing ideas to the administration. "When we have an issue like this it
is easier when we have people of all different sexual orientations rallying behind

us. It makes it less of a special interest,"
says Suh.
They plan to obtain a charter for the
group and to draft a mission statement in
order to establish it as a separate entity
from SQU. The alliance currently has 40
people on its e-mail list and the majority
of them are straight. "People who are not
queer-friendly should not feel intimidated
about participating. In order for meaningful discussion to occur must have different viewpoints," reminded Young.
Their first meeting is set for Tuesday,
October 27 at 7:30 p.m. in the Intercultural Center. The announcement of this
alliance is a part of "Coming Out Week"
on campus which began this Wednesday
and ends on October 30th. Other events
that are being planned are a party this
weekend and a movie night on Oct. 27th.

College endowmen: a questionable investment
To the editor.
The reason that this college is
what it is, is because of the financial success which our endowment has been in the past.
Swarthmore College has the second best performing endowment
of any college in the country. The
sad fact of the matter is that the
companies which we invest in
have practices which run contrary
to the tradition and the spirit of
the school. We all know about
Nike and Disney's sweatshops,
Phillip Morris's tobacco, and
GE's contribution to nuclearmissile starter engines and military
exports to South America. In fact
if we go through the list we find

which simply perpetrate other major injustices.
This situation sucks, however if
we decide that we want to have an
elite liberal arts college we must
take this path. In my mind, the only
way in which the college can absolve it's guilt is to produce people
who will go on to fight the injustices of these companies. If you are
going to graduate and pursue a career with simply yourself in mind,
you should keep.in mind that your
education came through the oppression of people. Why don't you get
on the web, and actually take a close
look at what injustices Philip Morris has done, send for the Oxfam
briefing on Nike sweatshops. You
might realize what price people
have paid for your education. I honestly believe that unless you plan to

make a difference in the world, you
shouldn'tbe here. Sure we all have
the right to pursue our own interests, but if you choose Swarthmore
as a vehicle to do so, realize what
exactly you are benifiting from. I
think that none of us would say that
if we owned a company, it would
be okay to keep our workers locked
up for 18 hours a day, give them
only 2 toiltet breaks, and deny
muslims the right to pray according to their religious beliefs. Just
because there is another link in
front of us in the chain, doesn't
mean that we are not part of the
chain of events which leads to Nike
acting in this manner. I just hope
that you will all keep this in mind,
when you choose your careers later
on in life.

Op-Ed
Don't flick your butts
on the ground
by Damon Taaffe

As

Travolta leans out
the HMMWV and
casually flicks his
cigarette onto the
parched soil, the patented Woo gratuitous slow-motion
renders a "flick...flick...flick"
sound as the butt spins toward the
earth. Perhaps because the world
slows down one cue for him, or due
to his almost unrivaled screen presence, his on-screen companions, as
well as the audience, know that he
is one cool guy.
There's not much similarto Broken Arrow Travolta himselfaround
the Swarthmore campus. He would
undoubtedly be appalled at parties
if he were to see Swatties dancing
like upper-level chemistry classes
had inflicted irreparable damage
upon their nervous systems, and the

only presence most Swatties have
relates to the McCabe reserve desk.
One thing that he probably would
approve of, though, is the number
of butt-flicking Travolta wannabes
who their way across the campus
each day.
It's hard to understand quite why
people think that it's OK to, once
done with a cigarette, cast it randomly upon the ground. Wherever
people gather, tell-tale signs are
there: on the sidewalks outside the
rose garden where people wait for
the shuttle, on Parrish steps where
they gather to smoke, and outside
Wharton where for many study
breaks equate to a nicotine fix.
What's striking isn't that occasionally people are unable to take the
time to look for a place to dispose
of butts properly...after all, due to

various social stigmas, there's not
a trash can every three feet. Instead,
the thing that's most disturbing is
that it's quite evident that most
people don't even look to see if
there's somewhere to throw them
away, nor do they feel the slightest
bit of self-consciousness as they
grind their cigarettes into the cement with their feet. They don't
look around to see if they're being
watched, and if someone makes a
point of staring at them, their response is one of indignance and
defiance instead of guilt.
How has it come about that
people would feel strange about
emptying trash cans onto the sidewalk or throwing whole sheets of
paper to the ground, yet they have
no compunction about this? There
are several possibilities. First, it's

such a small
thing...after all, won't it biodegrade
within a couple of days? The veritable drifts of them on the curbs
near intersections are answer in of
themselves, but the morality is no
different: if one has trash, isn't it
proper to put it in a can instead of
on the street?
A second possibility, which has
actually been expressed when I've
asked people about this, is twofold:
everyone else does it, and it's workers jobs to sweep them up anyway.
The first point is, of course, of little

merit: one need only
say that in most other places
people leave the sink running while
brushing their teeth, an action that
can lead to bodily harm in Swat's
dorms. We hold ourselves to different standards than do the vast
majority of Americans, and this is
no place for an exception. The second part of this answer, that workers clean them up, I shall dub the
"Job Creation Program From Hell"
argument. It's certain that no one
relishes the task of sweeping unsanitary bits ofrefuse into piles and
gathering them, and additionally,
were there to be no butts on the

Promise Keepers unjustly accused
By

now, most people are probably familiar with the series of rallies in
football stadiums across America
put on by the organization Promise Keepers. Their October 4th Stand In The Gap
rally on the National Mall in Washington,
D.C., has brought them a lot of coverage
recently. With commentary ranging from
national TV news to the damning op-ed
column in the last Phoenix, Promise Keepers has had a number of accusations leveled against it.
Based on seven "promises," which constitute the equivalent of a statement ofpurpose for the group, Promise Keepers is a
religious revivalist movement. It is, as the
journalist Rich Lowry has written, "in an
American tradition of religious revivals
going back to [Jonathan] Edwards"-a tradition from which has formed such institutions as the YMCA. The aim of Promise
Keepers is to make Christian men better
Christian fathers, husbands, workers, employers, etc., but is not, like the Christian
Coalition, to advocate a political agenda.
It is true that any organization that has a
rally on the National Mall is, in one sense,

"political," as it addresses the American
public. In its essence, though, Promise
Keepers is not political and departs from
previous movements which have rallied on
the Mall. The Promise Keepers' message
is directed to American men, but, unlike
the anti-war movement of the '6os, for example, not to the United States government.
It is not, by the nature of its message, interested in affecting policy.
Take, for instance, its message of racial
reconciliation, which has been called,
"fuzzy," and, "amorphous." This skepticism
is grounded in the fact that Promise Keepers does not call for action against institutional racism or address problems of urban housing and education. Such criticism
misses the central theme of the Promise
Keepers' message, which is not about finding political solutions to society's problems-nor about denying theneed for suchbut rather about putting right personal relationships.
This putting right is the Promise Keepers' message, and they believe that at the
core of better relationships among people
is a better relationship with God. The first

by Jude Uzonwanne

The

of the Promise Keepers' seven promises is
a commitment to, "honoring Jesus Christ
through worship, prayer, and obedience."
That honoring, that right relationship with
God and the belief that from only it will
follow better relationships among people
is the focus of the Promise Keepers' rallies. All the rest of the organization's message has to be seen in this light, or it will
be seen in distortion.
This is especially true in reference to the
Promise Keepers' call for men to regain
leadership of their families. Reflection on
what it means when Promise Keepers speak
of men leading women and families will
inevitably be misinterpreted when not seen
in its Christian context. Indeed, how could
it not cause some anxiety in non-Christian
citizens brought up in a time and place in
which many relationships, and not only
those of leading and following, are seen to
be defined by power and control?
The chasm between these Christian and
secular visions of leadership is touched on
in the twentieth chapter of the gospel of
Matthew: "You know that the rulers of the
Gentiles lord it over them, and their high

negotiations where a closely guarded se

tober, the parties announced a deal that
stunned the United States. Frances Total,
Malaysias Petronas, and Russias Gazprom
had agreed to a $2 billion gas deal with the Iranian government. The U.S. State Department furiously denounced the deal. In response Total of France, which
has France's and the European Unio'ns backing, dismissed the State Department's protestations, arguing
that Americas laws are inapplicable beyond her borders. Russias Gazprom, a multi-billion dollar concern
whose backers include Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin, curtly responded that Americas threats
would not be kindly received. Petronas, Malaysias state
energy company, laid out a not too dissimilarresponse.
What is the hoopla about?
In 1996, the U.S. Congress voted in favor of a bill,
the Iran-Libya sanctions act which penalizes firms from
investing more than $2O million in the oil and gas industry ofeither Libya or Iran on the grounds that both
states officially sanction terrorism. Since its passage,
the law Has not being tested until now. The Iran-Libya
law calls for placing restrictions on offending companies such as making it impossible for them to raise funds
in U.S. financial markets. Thus, Gazprom which is about
to raise $1 billion in American capital markets via its investment bankers, Goldman, Sachs & Company, would
be prevented from doing so, or at best, forced to accept
higher interest rates than necessary as investor percep-

officials exercise authority over them. Not
so with you. Instead, whoever wants to
become great among you must be your servant, and whoever wants to be first must
be your slave-just as [Christ] did not come
to be served, but to serve..." This is the
Christian leadership that Promise Keepers
is advocating-not domination but service,
and not the service which sets aside time
in the day to give but a complete submission to attention and care. An exceptional
example of such leadership is Mother
Theresa who, in submitting to service of
the poor of India, became not only an abbess but an internationally recognized
leader.
The Phoenix article asked the question,
"how do you combat spousal abuse?" The
author then presented a quote from a Promise Keepers spokesperson in which men
were encouraged to take back leadership
of their families. The quotation was presented in a way that suggests it was an answer to the question. Even if misleading,
the coupling can provide a useful illustration, for the same question was asked by
anecdote in the October 6th TIME maga-

tions of the risk embedded in the deal is driven up.
What makes the current conundrum particularly perplexing for the American government, and perhaps trend setting for global firms, are the issues it raises. To what extent can the United States unilaterally shape the face of
the globe in the post-Cold war years? Should laws passed
by American legislators under questionable circumstances,
and signed by an executive branch whose corruption is
increasingly evident to theentire world, become the framework for the rest of the planet? Is America deluding herself by continuing to believe that sovereign states retain
power to shape the world when the world is dominated by
transnational corporations whoseannual revenues outstrip
the gross domestic products of most countries? Some firms
increasingly think America is.
The question firms like Total, Gazprom and Petronas pose
is this: if America has a gripe with another state, why should
they be penalized in the process? In fact, should the narrow foreign policy interests of a nation-statebe reason to
circumscribe legitimate economic activity? Without making explicit reference to it, these firms believe that the summer election of Mr. Khatami, Irans new moderate president should be taken as an opportunity to re-engage the
country, and not continue its near diplomatic isolation.
Though radical members of the Iranian opposition beg to
differ, many global firms see Mr. Khatamis election as a
chance to ease the tensions with Iran, a strand of thinking
that leads to the conclusion that nothing must be done to
damage Mr. Khatamis ability to outflank Irans conservative mullahs. The Iran-Libya Act in their minds, unfortu-

motivated

by self-interest of higher education. So
instead, let's ask about how Swarthmore
College can interact with its community in
ways that best help the college realize its

own institutional objectives.
The resources of the college include
strong administrative skills, intellectual
capital in the form of faculty and research
facilities, and an abundant supply of cheap
and motivated highly skilled labor i.e. students. Furthermore, we have prestige, credentials, and connections. The college has
a comparative advantage in performing activities that require intellectual capital. For
example, at various levels the college
would be good at developing public policy,
conducting and evaluating research
projects, grantwriting, fundraising, and
providing technical and administrative
support. At least at the faculty level, the
college would be at a comparative disadvantage in terms of dealing with many of
the task-oriented activities generated from
their plans. Academics are good at painting an entire canvas. If you want to cover
a small spot on the wall, it would be more
efficient to hire a painter. Let's assume
we're calling the "community" some dis-

by Christian Mikkelson
zine article on Promise Keepers. That ar-

ticle relates the story of a man who abused
his wife in 1994, was jailed, released, and

i

then began attending Promise Keepers with
his pastor. Today, his wife says he, "is so
romantic and attentive that it is sometimes
unnerving." Having both the Promise
Keepers' rhetoric and the actions of this
man affected by Promise Keepers as parallel answers to the same question makes
a fine mirror of the relation of Christian
leadership to loving care.
The Promise Keepers do not advocate
lying to women or controlling women, and
the rallies do not ignore the problems of
marital abuse, as The Phoenix op-ed piece
suggested. Instead, they directly address
problems of, among others, marriage and
family from a perspective which seeks to
mend human relationships by first improving men's relationships with God. Just as
it is distorting to take the words of Promise Keepers speakers out of context, so is
it distorting to present the role that Promise Keepers is calling men to fill in America
without examining the element of submission and service in Christian leadership.

cret while they lasted. Suddenly in early Oc

Swarthmore College is playing host to
the Philadelphia Higher Education Network for Neighborhood Development
(PHENN) conference this weekend.
PHENN is a consortium of about 17 local
colleges and universities interested in defining and developing a role for higher education in the community. You might inquire about how can colleges fulfill their
community responsibilities in ways that
best help them realize their educationaland
research goals. Embedded in this statement
is the assumption that colleges do have
some sort of responsibility in the community. A good number of people would argue that intellectual growth and development of social conscience best occurs in
the classroom. On the other hand, nobody
can challenge the efficacy of doing

ground, they wouldn't have to
spend their time in such a demeaning pursuit.
Ultimately, people are going to do
what they want to unless others
speak up against it. I'll be the first:
if you're going to smoke, that's
your right, but don't throw your
trash down right in front of me and
expect that I won't notice or mind.
It's sadly ironic to see Swatties living in such a beautiful surrounding
who nonetheless see no contradiction in smelling a flower with one
hand while casting down a cigarette
with the other. Before one goes into
Chester to fight against the incinerator, or signs a petition to fine a
polluting company, one should
think about her own actions, right
here, right now. It's just wrong.

advantaged place like Chester or North
Philadelphia.
It should be self-evidentthat the community could certainly benefit from the resources available in institutions of higher
education. Some might argue that the
"community knows best," however this
may not be the case. Respecting members
of a community is not the same as feigning ignorance for the sake of congenial relations. There are bound to be disagreements which is why it is important for the
college to chose community partners who
share the same vision. This vision needs
to be spelled out with clear goals and objectives, otherwise the whole engagement
turns into frivolous social affair to be discussed in cademic discourse. In the ideal
situation, the college merely supports communities pursue their own goals and objectives. Unfortunately, there are often
worst-case scenarios where the community
lacks goals and effective leadership.
There is no reason to presume that

nately threatens to close the opening.
These non-American firms are not alone in their thinking and action. Earlier in 1997, Unocal, a California based
oil company that had significant interests in Mynmars
oil and gas industry decided to change its status from an
American firm to a global firm: it moved its headquarters to Singapore. Unocal executives, justifying the move,
argued that American laws are increasingly hampering
U.S. firms ability to participate in international business
deals. Case in point: Conoco, a U.S. company had originally won the contract Total and her allies just signed.
Conoco forced to back down under U.S. government pressure, feels rather slighted seeing that arch rival Total is
leading the syndicate executing the deal.
Thus the emergent trend in transnationalbusiness circles
is to disrespect national laws that are viewed as unnecessary and partisan in origination. Such disregard send a
clear signal to the national government in question that it
needs to mend its ways. Such signalling make it clear
that in a world in which corporations are increasingly
more powerful than governments, the United States and
other governments have to start asking some tough questions of themselves. And the purpose of this exercise? To
concentrate their minds on the fact that a world in which
only governments shaped foreign policy has come and gone.
It is unfortunate that only via a confrontation that such a
realization may emerge. But it ultimately remains necessary for governments to recognize non-state actors as legitimate partners in decision making processes. I cannot
but raise my glass of jolly liquids to that recognition.

by Bryan Gobin

Swarthmore has any self-interest in making any substantial committment to the
community. According to the College mission statement, the purpose of the College
is to develop the intellectual potential of
the student so that she may become a productive member of society. Granted our
mission statement also includes developing socially responsible members of a
democratic society, therefore the College
has an incentive to encourage students to
have positive interactions with the community, but only insofar as community interaction develops a sense of social responsibility. The College fulfills its mission so
long as the student acquires positive experience with no. negative impact on the community. It is simply a bonus if College affiliated activities actually make a difference. CIVIC provides a limited number
of grants for community service. Is there
justification for anything more substantial?
Let us look at the incentives. If you are a
big city university surrounded by disadvan-

taged community, you must necessarily
worry about the well-being of the surrounding neighborhood because the quality of
life of the university residents is directly
related to their environment. But the closest disadvantaged community to
Swarthmore is five miles down Chester
Road, so necessity is out of the question.
Assume that Swarthmore College maximizes four variables: 1) educational output i.e. the quality of education for its students 2) prestige of the institution 3) the
happiness of the faculty and staff 4) income
e.g. gifts, donations, and tuition. It's not
altogether clear to me what exactly the college is suppose to do given these incentives. There are advocates community for
community-based learning(CßL), but putting CBL into practice is easier said than
done. Moreover, learning from the community and making a difference aren't necessarily the same thing. Maybe the PHENN
conference will shed some light on the subject.

what their role in life should be."
Although the March is supported by the Nation of Islam and
its leader Louis Farrakhan, it is
not associated with any religious
organization. After 1995's Million Man March, which was organized by the Nation of Islam,
African-American women felt
that a separate march for females
was needed because of the differences between being a black man
and a black woman.
For example, African-American
women are more likely to pursue
higher education and to live past
the age of twenty-one than African-American men. "When we
focus on black issues, we tend to
focus on issues of black men and
issues of black women tend to be
overlooked," says Stokely-White.
"I think this is key....we need to
be a support system not just for
black men, but for ourselves."
After this Saturday's march,
Farrakhan plans to begin organizing one for the year 2000 to represent the black family.
But no matter how early the
planning begins, unfortunate
problems can still be encountered. For instance, the March's

use to describe a full-grown adult's overpowering need to be powdered, diapered, and gently
tucked into an oversized crib. It's more than
just a clinical condition, though, it's a bona fide

That's how it felt.
Liz: We went up in a tiny blue and white

names like Skip and Joe.
Patrick: That's why I've decided to change
my name to Steel. What do you think?
Liz: That's great. Then you can become
an editor/jumpmaster.
Patrick: I think the scariest part was noticing that it was time to crawl out onto the
little step on the side of the plane, and then
hang on the wing strut until Dick yelled
"Go!" Thankfully, both of us were tough
enough to go off when he screamed the
first time. I was worried that if I didn't jump
he was gonna come out and kick my ass.

by Katrina Clark
The first time I thought I was gay was
in the third grade. The thought occurred
to me but I pushed it away. I figured it
was just another way for me to get attention. Anyway, I wasn't exactly sure what
being gay meant. I knew that it was a
"bad" thing like being "fat" or "ugly".
Whenever someone my age—around
seven to nine—wanted to insult someone
we called them "gay" or "homo". I knew
that if I were gay I couldn't ever tell anyone or I'd be laughed at forever.
For many years, I wondered whether I
was gay. At one point I thought, "Yeah,
you probably are," but I didn't consider
telling anyone. Actually, I became rather
"boy crazy". This lasted from about
grades six through nine. I went out with
boy after boy hardly stopping to breathe
between each one.
This started to slow down in tenth grade.

I became extremely depressed and started
to see a therapist. I began to tell her of
things I had never talked about before,
things I was terrified to admit. At that point
I didn't have any real female friends because I didn't know how to talk to girls.
Basically I was having the same problem
many teenagers had with hormones and
new feelings about the opposite sex, only
my feelings were about girls. However, I
still didn't admit these feelings, not even
to myself. So I was very lonely.
In eleventh grade my depression wasn't
as bad as it had been before. I became
more outspoken about things in general,
especially sex. I also found my first best
friend. That year we spent so much time
together. We slept over at each other's
houses every weekend during the school
yearand then almostevery day in the summer. I started seeing this boy who I thought
was perfect in every way. We introduced
my best friend to his best friend and ev-

erything was perfect. That is until he told
me that he really liked my best friend. I
was rather upset about this but the part
that scared me most was that she would
ditch me and go to him.
In one of my last conversations/arguments with him he made a comment that
really shook me up. He said, "What, are
you in love with her or something?" I
almost died right there on the phone. It
just hit me that I was in love with her or
maybe that I liked her in a more than
friend kind of way. I didn't know what
to do or where to go. I needed to talk
about this with someone.
I ended up calling a teen hot-line. I kind of
stuttered out that I thought I was gay. The
lady asked me why I thought this? I told her
the story and she emphasized that it probably wasn't true. Now I was really confused.
Luckily, it happened that at a project I
was working for that summer, a group
joined that was from a center for gay/

lesbian/bisexual/transgendered/questioning (LGBTQ) youth. Some of them held
a Sensitivity Training for the rest of the
project's participants. During this presentation another girl from the audience came
out. The fact that she was fifteen and so
courageous really pushed me to talk.
I decided that one day I would go to
my boss. She was young, open-minded,
and I knew that I could trust her. I still
was scared to say anything, so I wrote in
my journal that I thought I was bisexual
and I liked my best friend. I showed the
journal to my boss, who gave me a hug
and asked if I had told my best friend. My
boss thought that she would understand.
I finally got up the courage to tell my
best friend. She completely understood
and wondered why I didn't tell her in the
first place. I was rather relieved after that
but I knew there were other people I had

people that fly up the three thousand feet and then refuse to jump.
One girl in our course actually said
she wouldn't jump while she was
in the plane. She did, though, and
loved it.
Patrick: I think the $215 is pretty
much incentive to get you out of
the plane. But once the chute
opened it was heaven, baby.
Liz: It was like flying. When I
jumped, I got a rush of adrenaline
through my body and began counting one thousand, two thousand,
three thousand...when I saw the
white circle of parachute open
above me I was dizzy with relief.
Before the jump, I was seriously

thinking I might not live more than
the next few hours. All the voices
in my head (this paper is due, I have
to call this person, I have to go to
the bathroom) were silenced. There
was only the moment, because
when you jump screaming out of a
plane, there's nothing but now.
Patrick: There was only one voice
in my head, and it was saying,
"Why is that backpack strap so tight
around my crotch?"
Liz: When I was floating with the
parachute, I noticed the silence that
filled and surrounded me. Among
the clear blue of sky and the white
ofcirrus clouds, I looked down and
saw the scarlet, orange and yellow
foliage of autumn woodsamong the
peaceful squares offarmland.
Patrick: The moment, that special

moment when I let go was a singu-

lar experience. Nothing can quite
describe the sensation, and I
think most skydivers have a special glimmer in their eyes that
comes from this moment. It was
beautiful.
Liz: I panicked, though, when I
realized that I couldn't see the white
cross on the ground that I was supposed to steer toward. Sky-divers
steer themselves by pulling wooden
bars called toggles that are attached
to the parachute straps. I grabbed
my right toggle in a panic and began tugging. Luckily, I was
equipped with a radio and could listen to an instructor who directed me
to safety.
Patrick: The three minutes floating in air pass both as a silent eter-

nity and as a few fleeting seconds.
My senses were on overload and it
was good someone on the ground
was telling me what to do. But in
the end the ground came at me like
a freight train. Dick said, "Landings can be rough." Dick should
have said, "Landings can be murder." After I landed, I collected
myself and stood up, and was delighted to find that I could still walk.
And then I saw Liz coming in at
full throttle; she hit like a ton of
bricks. I got nervous, but she was
a real trooper.
Liz: I finally saw the cross on the
ground as an instructor began yelling that I should prepare to land. I
was so busy concentrating on keeping my legs and ankles together, as
I had been trained, that I didn't re-

I landed on my butt, and was filled
with the shock of pain. My first
thought as I landed was "I'm alive!"
Then it was "I'm in pain!" I shook
my legs to make sure I could move
and lay on the ground, feeling
stunned. When I got over the
shock, I was filled with the simple
joy of being alive.
Patrick: Even though it was a beginners' jump(we went out at 3000'
but free-fall divers normally jump
at 10000'), there was so much
excitment surrounding the experience, and so much joy after everything turned out well, that I couldn't
help but regain a more positive outlook on life in general. It's that kind

they are not guaranteed immunity even in
our tiny corner of the world.
The essential point is that it would be a
shame to lose the fragments, snapshots, and
voices from around the globe that we are
fortunate enough to have returning to our
campus every semester to collective silence. I implore you to ask your friends and
students who were abroad about their experiences. Seemingly simple questions
might force them to undergo the challenging process of reevaluating conclusions
they have already formed about their travels. Be attentive to the disorientation they
face in reconciling the identity they established abroad with that left behind at the
end oflast semester.
Regretfully I did not do this with my
friends who went away prior to my own
semester abroad. Unless I do so now, I will
forego the opportunity to travel vicariously
to China or to France through the minds of
people whom I respect and admire. So
please, take a study break and listen to the
stories of your returning friends. I can almost guarantee that they will be receptive

dabble in something new; unfortunately, in this genre, Boyz II Men
simply sound out of their element.
Sadly, the next two tracks bring
more of the same. Pompous lyrics

an unnecessarily relentless beat are
the predominant elements of Baby

predecessors, but it still misses the
mark for the above-mentioned reasons. It is not until track 11 that the
listener gets some respite, with
Human 11-—an apologetic song that,
because of its smoothly flowing
chorus and quick tempo, immediately becomes catchy.
Unfortunately, the second-to-last
song, To the Limit, is yet another
failure. For one, the synthesized

background cheerily bounces
around and is an extraneous and
annoying aspect of the song that
detracts from its lyrics and
downplays its supposed solemnity.
Secondly, it takes remorse too far
and winds up sounding pathetic,
with a chorus that starts /'// rub
your back/Wash your hair/I'll do
anything/I don't care and goes
downhill from there. The fact that
the singers shamelessly beg for forgiveness overshadows their apologetic message and stretches the
realm of the whole genre too far;
one wants to feel sad and regretful
along with the artist, but the idea
of going "to the limit," of degrading oneselffor forgiveness, quickly
destroys the mood and kills the
song as a whole.

of work, but it doesn't fit well
within the album. An expression of
appreciation to God with extremely
sober lyrics and vocals, it does an

away without providing an outlet for the
knowledge gleaned from these experiences
upon their return. To make a crude economic analogy—it is like exporting capital without demanding any return.
What I am recommending is a more attentive environment for mutual conversation
between returning students and the
Swarthmore community. Extensive discussion of impressions and ideas garnered
abroad could benefit Swarthmore tremendously. For example, individualism is a
highly esteemed quality in our community.
A widely accepted social code known as
janteloven causes its polar opposite, egalitarianism, to assume an extreme form in
Denmark. Two of the tenets of the
janteloven are "thou shalt not believe thou
art something" and "thou should not believe thou amountest to anything". Compare these principles with what Dean Gross
told my class on the first day of freshman
year: "no matter what they say or do to me,
I am still a worthwhile person". It could
be argued that the janteloven creates social equality, or alternatively, that it stifles

initiative and self-reliance. In any case, it
would be valuable to contrast these outlooks in order to evaluate the
Swarthmorean emphasis on individuality
and diversity.
The Swarthmore community should provide a better forum for the voices of returning students, even if it occurs on the
informal basis of discussion and sharing
of ideas amongst friends. This dialogue
need not be based on topics as serious as
ideas of social equality. A discussion of
favorite Danish rap music (it sounds somewhat like a cross between Puff Daddy talking with a potato in his mouth and the kind
ofnoises that you had your mouth washed
out with soap for making as a child) might
be just as constructive.
This should not be a one-sided effort;
returning students should draw on their
experiences abroad in the course of their
daily Swarthmore routine. They should
continue to use their skills of evaluation
and redefinition in order to consider their
assumptions about Swarthmore in light of
new experiences. They should remember
and communicate the possibility ofaccelerated change, a phenomenon from which

SPORTS

Men's rugby comes up short against York
Dan Barrick
Men's
rugby team traveled
Jhe
to York University on October 11
to play their final division match
of the season. Looking for a big
win before heading off for break,
the Buzzards were low in numbers
.but not spirit. The game started
By

well for the Buzzards, who were
anxious to taste victory.

Coming out with aggression and
Swarthmore struck York
hard for the opening 20 minutes,
keeping the ball within their 22meter line for much of the first
half. Unfortunately, every time
Swarthmore got close enough to
score, they would turn the ball
over to York, who would keep it
frenzy,

clear of the try zone.
One maul actually was driven
into the tryzone by Swarthmore,
and appeared to be toucheddown
by a combination of Swarthmore
players, but the referee claimed
he did not see the possession and
called it out. 'That was our biggest problem on Saturday," said
center Ryan Madder 'OO, "we
just couldn't score when it really
mattered, when we were that
close to their try-zone." This relentless attack by the Evil Buzzards continued for several minutes, until finally, on a misdirection play to the fullback, they
were able to sneak a try around
the opposing wing. Apparently
angered by the well-executed

Buzzard offence, York quickly retaliated by scoring two of their
own before the half.
The second half continued in
much the same fashion. The Buzzards executed beautifully at times,
but could not find a breakdown in
the York defense until a series of
well-placed kicks by fly-half Dan
Barrick '9B, and scrum-halfJerome
Bushnell '99, as well as strong pursuit by Mike Sheer '99, and Ryan
Madder 'OO, resulted in a dramatic
try by Madder. However, it seemed
as though every score by the Buzzards could be matched by one
from York. Down by three scores
with little time remaining, theBuzzards scrambled frantically to push
a few more in before the final

whistle blew.
Finding themselves in the five
meters from the try line the Buzzards would not go down quietly.
With time running out, outside
center George Rosenbaum 'OO
broke through the now-ragged
York backline to touch down the
final Swarthmore try of the day,
and bringing the score to 35-15.
Swarthmore enters the final
stage ofits season in the next two
weeks, playing the University of
Pennsylvania this Saturday and
Bucknell at home on November
1. As the Bucknell match will
be the only one played on
DuPont Field by the Buzzards
this fall season, it is bound to be
quite exciting.

SPECIAL QUEST

Women's Tennis strong for the spring
By

Laurie Smith

The women's tennis team ended

their fall season on a high note at

the Capitol Classic Tournament on
the weekend of October 11th and
12th. The tournament, which was
held at Catholic University in
Washington DC, brought together
Swarthmore, the University of
iNOtre Dame of Maryland, Wesley,
Goucher College, Catholic University, University of Scranton,
Marywood, and Dickinson College to compete against each other.
Swarthmore sent six members of

the team to the tournament, including JenniferPao in flight one
singles, Rani Shankar in flight
two singles, Wendy Kemp in
flight three singles, Jennifer Pao
and Rani Shankar in flight one
doubles, and Michaela De
Soucey and Stacy Wagaman in
flight three doubles.
All six members of the team
made it to at least the semi-finals,
which is even more of a special
victory because all of the other
schools except Dickinson were
Division 2. "Everyone played
well," said Michaela. Three of

the players, however, went all the
way and took first place. They
were Jennifer Pao in singles,
Wendy Kemp in singles, and Jennifer Pao and Rani Shankar in
doubles.
De Soucey and
Wagaman, after losing their first
match, also came out victorious
because they then went ahead to
win the consolation match. After
the tournament was over, the
teammates came away "really excited because winning in three
flights is a lot," stated Michaela
De Soucey.
Now that the fall season is offi-

cially over, the team will start
their own workouts in anticipation of spring. Practice for the
regular season will start right after winter break, and their first
competitive matches will begin
during spring break when they
travel to Hilton Head, South
Carolina for matches outside of
their conference. Overall, the fall
season gave Coach Sears a
chance to set up the ladder and
put the team together while the
team members got to get in some
practice before the upcoming
season.

Enthusiasm for athletics in general
'at Swarthmore, which, they suggest, places a glass ceiling on its
level of competitiveness. "At

Swarthmore, sports are seen as ex-

tra-curricular," said co-captain Bernard Nossulit '9B, "they aren't taken
seriously and this is the wrong attitude to have in competitive situations." "It's hard to maintain enthusiasm in an environment that
doesn't care whether the program

lives or dies," said O'Connell.
Aleffi and others blame the Admissions Office for not doing more
to recruit athletes to Swarthmore.
Bob Williams, athletic director of
the College, admits that there has
been no consistentprogram for recruiting at the college in the 11
years he has been here, but credits
the present administration with
making a real effort to work with
the athletic department in attracting athletes to the school. "The
administration cares about athlet-

ics as they care about all we do at
the college," Williams remarked.
In a statement issued by the
President's Office, Al Bloom lamented the loss and reiterated the
college's commitment to maintaining high standardsfor both the football team and the athletic program.
"It is very depressing for all of us
that the football team is losing
members particularly in the context
of a very frustrating season," he
wrote," The administration is committed to building a team which will

be able to compete successfully,
represent the College with pride,
offer our student athletes the opportunity for personal development and the satisfaction and fun
they deserve."
"It will take time to rebuild the
football program... Intercollegiate athletics is a critical component of our educational program and must reflect the commitment to excellence that this
community brings to everything
we do."

Field hockey mounts strong attack
By

Jean Quinn

The field hockey team regrouped after
their loss to Washington College before
break and bounced back with three solid
wins, taking the team's record to 14-1 overall, 5-1 in the conference. The Garnet
routed Ithaca 1-0, College of Notre Dame
of Maryland 7-0, and Muhlenberg 3-0.
The Garnet's game against Ithaca was a
closely contested one. Both teams are
ranked highly in their respective regions,
Swarthmore is 4th in the South Atlantic
division and Ithaca 2nd in the North Atlantic region. The National Field Hockey

The Garnet Tide dropped two
contests over fall break to bring
their overall record to 0-6. After a
defeat
crushing
against
Muhlenberg, the Tide flew to sunny
Southern California for a contest
against Pomona-Pitzer.
The Tide started off the break by
hosting a winless Muhlenberg
team. Many felt that this game
would be the one that would finally
put Swarthmore in the win column.
However, the Mules scored early
and often, leading at the end of the
first quarter 21-0, and at the half 340. The running game decimatedthe
Tide with Muhlenberg rushing for
240 yards in the half, compared to
-3 for Swarthmore.
During the second half,
Muhlenberg extended its lead to 530 before Swarthmore finally
reached the scoreboard. Sophomore Joe Aleffi, who had another
terrific day running, scored on a
three yard touchdown run. On the
Garnet's next possession, a 45 yard
Aleffi run set up a nine yard touchdown pass to Mason Tootell '99.
Freshman Rob Castelucci con-

Association's Division 111 Poll ranked the
Garnet Bth and Ithaca 10th. Erika Williams 'Ol scored the lone goal of the game,
assisted by Jen Hagan '99. Goalie Jane
Kendall 'OO recorded eight saves in the
shut-out.
Coach Karen Borbee said, "The Ithaca
game was a huge win for us. We had just
come off a very frustrating loss to Washington and the players came back fired up
and ready for the challenge of a top rate
team. I thought the game was played at a
very high level and our team took advantage of thebreaks we got and Ithaca didn't."

Swat faced CNDM at the end ofOctober
break without two of their top scorers.
Danielle Duffy '9B had an interview, and
Lurah Hess '99 is still recovering from surgery on her hand. The team 's offense did
not seem diminished though, as the Garnet outshot their opponent 29-0 en route to
their 7-0 win.
Holly Baker '99 and Donna Griffin '99
led the squad: Baker recorded a hat trick
and a pair of assists, while Griffin scored
twice and notched two assists as well.
Hagan scored and picked up an assist, and
Rebecca Stites 'OO accounted for the last

goal. Freshmen Krista Hollis, Kristen English, and Kate Vivalo all earned assists in
the outing. "We have so many people who
can score that it's hard for a team to stop
everyone. Our second half was one of the
best we have played all year long," said
Borbee.
On Tuesday, the Garnet traveled to
Muhlenberg and picked up an important
conference win, despite bad field conditions and poor officiating. Baker scored
off a penalty stroke to give the team the
lead, and Duffy found the back of the cage
on a break-away in the second half. Kristen

Women

verted both extra points.
After the tough loss, the Tide
packed their bags and took off for
the golden state, hoping that their
fortunes would change on the other
side of the country.
With Californian alumni and current students scattered throughout
the stands, the Tide were ready to
face Pomona in the sweltering heat.
The Tide got off to a sluggish start
and fell behind 35-0 after one quarter, en route to a 76-12 thrashing.
Tony Hillery 'Ol made the play of
the game, however, with all yard
interception return for a touchdown
in which he broke several tackles
and dove into the end zone.
The losing streak has now hit 16
games, and so far this year the Tide
have been outscored 360-41. The
only numbers that are as striking
could be seen by comparing the
roster size of Swarthmore against
that of their opponents. With the
loss of several players who decided
to hang up the spikes for the year
(see page 1), Swarthmore will be
hard-pressed to defeat their next
three opponents who are also the
top three teams in the conference.
Up next for the Tide is at home
against Franklin and Marshall.

The men's and women's cross
country teams both showed strong
performances at the Dickinson Invite on October 11, and for the
men's team as well at the Allentown
College Invitational on October 18.
Both teams finished in seventh
place overall at Dickinson, out of a
large pool of 36 teams for the men's
race and 33 teams women's race.
At Allentown, the men finished in
11th place overall out of 30 teams.
At Dickinson, Phil Jones '9B
placed first for Swarthmore and
42nd overall with a time of 27:50
on the 8K course, followed closely
by GrahamLucks '9B in 44th place
at 27:54. Sam Evans 'Ol, out for
much of the beginning of the season injured, was able to pull into
third place for Swarthmore at
28:07. Jeff Doyan '99 and Wyn
Strodtbeck '9B finished with times
of 28:25 and 28:28, respectively.
"As the season's progressed
we've seen the young runners take
a strong role in the team, punctuated by their success at the
Dickinson Invitational," said
Strodtbeck.
For the women, Danielle Wall '9B
and Joko Agunloye 'Ol were at the
front of the pack, leading
Swarthmore with their 19th and
26th place finishes, at 19:48 and

19:55, respectively. Alissa
Parmalee '01(20:47), Karen Lloyd
'00(21:02), and Sarah McClure

team's points as well, rounding out
Swarthmore's top five runners.
"We definitely met our expectations at the meet. Our main challenge is now to beat Dickinson. We
just have to push ourselves a little
more to beat them, but we are definitely capable of accomplishing
that goal," said Sarah Howard '9B.
The men's team also fared well
at the Allentown College Invitational this past Saturday, despite
inclement weather. With an exceptional race, Lucks finished first
overall at 27:51. Jones(2B:32),
Evans(2B:4s), Mark Nierman
'01(28:48), and Strodtbeck(29:lo)
all ran through unfavorable rainy
conditions to help pull in the 11th
place finish. Doyan(29:2B) and
Derek Bruzewick(2g:42) finished
up Swarthmore's top seven.
"Our men's team once again
proved their depth has the potential to take them along this season,"
said Coach Ted Dixon.
The women did not compete at
Allentown, but will race this Saturday in the Seven Sisters Championship, to be held at Rosetree Park. For
the next two weeks, both the men's
and women's teams are looking towards the Conference Championships as their next goal to tackle.

While the majority of Swarthmore students were sitting on their couches veggin'
in front of the T.V., the women's rugby
team was hard at work mopping the floor
with the Scranton team. Swarthmore
dominated theentire 70 minute game, and
when the final whistle blew the scrore was
28-10.
The Swarthmore back line, led by captain Courtney Clark '9B, passed the ball
expertly and fooled Scranton defenders
left and right. Clark started the scoring
frenzy by diving into the try zone early in
the first half. Kira Cochran-Bond 'OO in
farewell performance scored the second
try of the game; unfortunately in the last
ten minutes ofherrugby season, CochranBond tore the ACL in her left knee (much* 1
to the chagrin of the basketball team). She
was valiently replaced by Cathy Vaughan
'Ol who performed beautifully in her Aside debut. Beth Vose '99 was on fire for
Swarthmore and scored back to back tries.
The Swat forward pack also got a large
piece of the action and never missed a
chance to rough up the opposition. Swat's
eight person scrum, commanded by captian
Becky Snyder '9B, dominated the entire
game, pushing Scranton onto their heels and
bringing the team within scoring distance
time and time again. Loose forwards
Bridget Arbour '9B, Danielle Thomas '99
and Alexa Miller 00 rucked and mawled
with force and precision, contributing to
Swathmore's offensive attack. Rhiana
Schwartz 'OO, playing her first A-side game
as loose head prop, scored both the final try
as well as a 3-point penalty kick.
The B-side game was an equally exciting game, despite the score of 7-10 in favor of Scranton. Many Swat players tried
their hand at a new position. Charity
Miller '9B resumed her former position at
scrum half, while Amber Halsey '9B
turned on the jets at weak side wing. Leading the Swarthmore scrum, which clearly'
dominated the game was Beth Wiles '9B
and Tracy McNeil 'OO. Together this duo
rucked over Scranton's intimidated forwards. Ursula Lang 'OO had a great game
at outside center, catching every pass
thrown to her by Morgan Kelly '9B,
flyhalf, whoexecuted the "scorching skip"
play often and well. Erica Anderson 'Ol
brought Scranton's backs to the ground
with her tenacioustackling. Swarthmore's
' converted try was scored by Schwartz who
took advantage of the hole in Scranton's
defense: Sarah Cross '99 created the space
for Schwartz by expetjly
Scranton's forwards back onto their heels.
The dominating A-side win qualified
Swarthmore to play in the EPRU championships this weekend at Princeton. While
the game is away, Swarthmore will give a
preview of their "stuff' on Friday at 1:00
in Parrish. Bring some cash for the dash.

Women's V'ball drops home opener
By

Claudia Zambra

Over break, the volleyball team first traveled to
Vassar College for the annual Seven Sisters tournament. They then returned to finish the first half
of the season with an astounding win over
Dickinson College on the following Tuesday.
Returning with high expectations, the volleyball
team was prepared to take on Washington College.
After weeks of early 5:00 am practices, the team
was finally rewarded for their commitment with
the inauguration of the new floor.
The first two games were incredibly tough for
both teams, even for Swarthmore who was feeling
quite at home on the new floor. There were various kills and skilled plays from both sides, and the
equal opposition intensified the games. Nevertheless, Swarthmore narrowly missed winning the first
two sets. This did not mean the end for the Garnet
Tide, however, who managed to keep their spirits
and their playing at a high level. Indeed they made
quite an appearance, with their cheering and mu-

sical talents, and also encouraged the team to continue the game which wasn't over yet.
Swarthmore managed to win the following two
sets in what was also a contested struggle. Holly
Barton displayed a series of kills, once again proving her consistency as an outside hitter, and as senior captain Jordan Hay claims, "Holly always
finds the hole." Swarthmore did not allow Washington to find many holes with player Kate
Schneider displaying some spectacular defense and
a great many digs. The whole team brought itself
up and was ready to face the decisive fifth set.
Decisive it was, but not in Swarthmore's favor.
Despite the wonderfulfans and encouraging teammates, the players let the match point slip away
from them in a very competitive rally point set. It
was a long, tough match for the Garnet, and it was
unfortunate to see them lose it after such a struggle.
It was nevertheless an intensive match for players and crowd, and hopefully the next and last
home game, against Haverford College, will be
highly populated by as many enthusiastic
Swarthmore fans.

Men's soccer suffers a hat trick of defeats
By

Danimal Lieberman

Although the results of the last three
games would not reflect it, Swarthmore
men's soccer has been playing extremely
well. If not for a few isolated lapses, Swat
could have easily won each of the last three
games. This seems to be the story of the
entire season for the men's team.
The men kicked off their fall break with
a trip to the big apple on October 11 to play
NYU. After clearing the turf field ofbums
and kids playing pickup games,
Swarthmore took the lead on a goal by
Mike "The Admiral" Schall. Off of a corner kick by James "Who's the Punisher
Now?" Chen, Schall buried the ball in the
back of the net. Swat controlled the play
for the entire first half, but an unfortunate
turn of events drastically changed the momentum with one minute left in the half.
NYU snuck a ball past goalkeeper Adam
"the Proverbial Junk Yard Dawg" Macßeth.
Swarthmore never regained the momentum. Forty-five minutes and two NYU
goals later, the men were officially on fall

break. It would have been nice for the men
to have had a W to go along with the turftoe and rug-burn they suffered, but they had
to be content with one halfof solid soccer.

After a week with no games, the men
traveled to Franklin and Marshall for a
league match against the Diplomats. Once
again, Swarthmore went up early, this time
on a goal by John "Coltrane" Kaltenstein.
The Diplomats then scored to tie things up.
A few minutes later, Swat went up 2 to 1.
Jedi Knight Lewis placed the ball at the
feet of Danimal Lieberman, who in turn
put it by the goalkeeper.
For the entire first half, Swarthmore controlled play. Shots rained on the Franklin
and Marshall keeper. Then early in the
second half, misfortune struck Swat. The
Diplomats got and converted two penalty
kicks in ten minutes. According to Toby
"The Terminator" Patterson "The calls
were questionable at best." This turn of
events demoralized Swarthmore. The team
could not seem to regain their composure
or control of the game. The score ended
up 5 to 2. Once again, Swarthmore played

one half ofexcellent soccer. One highlight
of the game was the outstanding play of
midfielders Austin Powers Harris and
Marcus "The Real Deal" Shin.
On Wednesday afternoon, Eastern College came out to Swarthmore for an afternoon match. The two teams fought hard
in the cold fall weather. The only goal of
the game came in the first half off a well
placed shot by one of Eastern's players.
Swarthmore had more than their share of
chances, but nobody could manage to convert. On the positive side, Macßeth did
dish out a concussion to one of the Eastern
Players and Scott "Superfly" Samels
handed out a facial to another.
This Saturday, Swarthmore travels to
Gettysburg for an afternoon match. The
men's team is looking to put together two
halves of good soccer against the tough
Gettysburg team. Then, on Sunday at 1
o'clock, the men face what could be their
biggest challenge all season. They face the
Alumni team on Clothier field. Next
Wednesday here at Swarthmore, the men's
team faces Ursinus College at 3 o'clock.
