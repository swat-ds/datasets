Hanna King recently filmed a protest at the Israeli prime minister's speech in New Orleans.
BY JACQUELINE SMALL
jsmall2@swarthmore.edu
The auditorium was packed with nearly 4,000 people listening intently to

Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister

of Israel, when a voice from the audience
called out, "The loyalty oath delegitimizes
Israel!" The voice belonged to an American
protestor, and so did the voices that soon
said, "The settlements delegitimize Israel!"
and "The occupation delegitimizes Israel!"
As the protestors were removed from the
crowd, who chanted in Hebrew, "The
nation of Israel lives!" a Swarthmore firstyear, Hanna King, stood by filming the
action. She and other college-age students
went to New Orleans to attend and demonstrate against Netanyahu's speech to the
Jewish Federations General Assembly on
Nov. Bth.
King is a member of Jewish Voice for
Peace, an organization that, according to
its online mission statement, "opposes
anti-Jewish, anti-Muslim, and anti-Arab

bigotry and oppression." It wants to end
the Israeli occupation of the West Bank,
Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem, and ensure

that both Israelis and Palestinians are
treated fairly. It decries attacks on civilians and seeks peace and justicefor all people living in of the Middle East.
Stefanie Fox 'O4, another member of
Jewish Voice for Peace, has acted as a mentor to King, and was active in the planning
of the protest. Part of the demonstration's
goal was to show that young Jews are not
apathetic about Israeli-Palestinian relations. "Given the current obsession within
the institutional Jewish community about
where young Jews are, we thought it
would be a perfect time to give young,
proudly Jewish activists the opportunity
to speak for themselves about where they
&re' and why Israel right-or-wrong politics
are driving them away," Fox said in an email.

THE PHOENIX

*

Originally, the group planned to have a
silent protest, where they would only hold
up signs with their messages, but they

feared that their signs would be taken
away or destroyed and they would be
removed from the audience without communicating their message. "We unanimously agreed with the decision to shout
what was on our signs, though many were
also sad to lose the solemnity of a silent
protest. We were not there to 'heckle' but to
speak out in an environment that silences
dissent and refuses us the opportunity to
make this point in another way," Fox said.
"We wanted to bring attention to
Palestinians who are being oppressed,"
King said. She and other members of
Jewish Voice for Peace also interviewed
people at the assembly for the Jewish
Voice for Peace website and for the website
for young adult members of JVP, youngjewishproud.org. "There are many more
nuanced opinions than the Jewish establishment wants to think," she said.
Josh Sokol 11, for one, said that his
opinion is more balanced. Though he considers himself a "liberal Zionist," he is
troubled by the settlementsand the loyalty
oath. However, "The broader insistence
that accepting Israel's legitimacy is a prerequisite to finding tenable solutions to the
Israel-Palestine conflict is not unexpected,
nor is it difficult to understand and justify," he said in an e-mail.
King could not, personally partake in
the protesting because, as a 17-year-old
minor, she could have been detained until
her parents came to get her, so she videotaped the reaction of the crowd instead.
King said that her parents and synagogue
are not critical of Israel, but that her family is beginning to reconsider its view.
She stressed that like other young Jews
who support Palestine, she "honors the
memory of the Holocaust and the terrible
experiences of our ancestors" but does not
think that the past justifies Israel's

November 18, 2010

actions. "A long history of conflict blinds
people to the conflict they're perpetuat-

ing," King said. "Perpetuating oppression
onto others is unacceptable."
The protests were reported by the
Associated Press and Haaretz (a Hebrew
word meaning, "the land"), the oldest daily
newspaper in Israel, where some commenters expressed support and admiration. Other commenters, though, criticized
the students as being immature, proPalestine and undeserving of being called
Jewish.

King, a prospective Peace and Conflict
Studies major, is committed to working for
peace, and says that Israel's actions toward
Palestine contradict Jewish values, such
as Tikkun Olam, the repairing of the
world's injustices. "[The oppression of
Palestinians] is not something I can live
with," she said.
Sokol, however, was less willing to rely
on religion to form political opinions. "I do
not agree with the idea that Jewish values
dictate a certain political stance on this
issue I think that there's room for conscientious people to acknowledge the complex political realities standing in the way
of peace, and to advocate for different, but
still realistic solutions," he said.
King, who is opposed to violence, said,
"Nonviolent action is the only way to end
conflict." She thinks that economic divestment is the best method to end Israel's
objectionable policies. The tactic of divestment, or boycotting a country or company's products, was used by Ghandi,
Mandela and Martin Luther King, Jr. "It
helped end apartheid, so it's a really very
effective peace tactic," King said.
Going forward, King intends to continue to raise awareness for Palestinians as
much as she can. "But my main focus right
now is on being a college student," she
said. "Ultimately, it's not my voice that
needs to be heard. I just want to be a conduit of attention to those who need it."

Seniors more likely to pack on extra pounds

It showed that of the 1,672 Indiana

spent less time each week engaged in
physical activity than other student

On average, seniors were about 17
pounds heavier than freshmen, the
study said.
Michelle George, the wellness coordinator at Student Health Services,
said she wasn't surprised by this phenomenon.
"When you are going from a very
structured home eating environment
to one that is typically quite the opposite, weight changes are likely to
occur," she said.
She attributed senior weight gain to

Four Loko cuts caffeine
as FDA tightens its belt
BY KELSEY SHEA

PITTNEWS.COM, NOV. 17, 2010
Four Loko will no longer have caffeine,
guarana or taurine, according to an

announcement its manufacturer released
late last night, only a few hours before the
Food and Drug Administration sent a
warning letter to the company.
The malt beverage has placed its manufacturer, Phusion Projects, in the center

of a national controversy over health concerns regarding caffeinated alcoholic bev-

erages, prompting bans in several states
and action from the FDA.
A few hours after the manufacturer's
announcement, the FDA issued a letter to
several companies advising that caffeine

constituted an "unsafe additive" in alcoholic drinks. Letters also went to Charge

Beverages Corporation, New Century
Brewing Company and United Brands
Company Inc.
Representatives from Phusion Projects
were not immediately available for comment.
The letter to Phusion Projects stated
that "a number of qualified experts have
concerns about the safety of caffeinated
alcoholic beverages" and went on to say
"the agency is not aware of data or other
information to establish the safety of the
relevant conditions of use for your product."
A news release from the FDA said that
the companies have 15 days to remedy the

violation of the Federal Food, Drug and
Cosmetic Act and prevent its recurrence.
Further action, including seizure of the
company's product, was possible under
federal law.
Phusion Projects released a statement
that both defended the product and conveyed its willingness to cooperate with
regulators and policy makers.
"We have repeatedly contended - and
still believe, as do many people throughout the country that the combination of
-

alcohol and caffeine is safe. If it were
unsafe, popular drinks like rum and colas
or Irish coffees that have been consumed

safely and responsibly for years would
face the same scrutiny that our products
have recently faced," the release said.
After several highly publicized incidents involving Four Loko
including an
incident in which nine, female students
were hospitalized at Central Washington
Michigan, Utah, Oklahoma,
University
New York and Washington state all
banned the drink before the FDA released
its letter today.
At the heart of the Four Loko controversy is the question of whether or not
caffeine and alcohol are safe when consumed together.
Pitt's Student Health Director Dr.

Elizabeth Wettick said the combination
could be dangerous for several reasons.
"Mixing caffeine and alcohol can
increase the risk of alcohol poisoning by
making people feel 'less drunk' which can
lead them to drink more alcohol for longer
periods of time," she said in an e-mail.
"Moreover, this can make you feel 'awake
drunk,' thus, making you feel more energetic even if you are drunk, which can
lead to more dangerous behaviors such as
driving drunk, violence or destructive
actions."
She added that the effects on other
parts of the body are harsh as well.
"Alcohol and caffeine are both diuretics, which can lead to dehydration (and
hangovers). The combination can also
make your heart rate and blood pressure
rise quickly and at a dangerous level.
Moreover, adding caffeine (an addictive
ingredient) to alcohol can make drinking
alcohol even more addictive," she said.
A 2006 study conducted by Wake Forest
University's school of medicine found that
North Carolina college students who
drank alcohol with caffeinated drinks
were nearly twice as likely to take sexual
advantage of another, be sexually taken
advantage of or ride with a driver who
was intoxicated.
The students who drank alcoholic
energy drinks were also more than twice
as likely to get hurt or require medical

Seasonal depression clouds students' happiness

symptoms similar to depression, according to BU associate professor of Psychology
Martha Tompson.
Tompson, a director at BU's

Treatment Lab, explained that
SAD is primarily related to
light exposure.

"In tropical zones, people
rarely have seasonal depression, but it doesn't seem to be
the change of seasons," she

said. "Rather, it appears to be
related to the amount of light
available. During the season
when the days are really
short, folks with this problem
get depressed."
Tompson said SAD is more
abundant in people who live
in the far north or south.
"The closer you are to the
poles the- more likely seasonal
depression is a problem," she
said.
Stefan Hofmann, director
of the Psychotherapy and
Emotion Research Laboratory
at BU, said people experience
SAD as a result of the shortened days in the winter.
"Seasonal affective disorder depends on the hours of
daylight exposure time, not on
the amount of sun exposure
per se, so a place with a lot of
sunlight but short days does

not help," he said.

"SAD is a dysregulation of
the biorhythm that determines the sleep-wake cycle.
Melatonin is an important

this," he added.

website
Television
Without

Pity
(www.televisionwithoutpity.com) has

an entire section devoted to such "brilliant-but-cancelled" fare as "Freaks and
"Firefly"
Geeks,"
and "Arrested
Development." However, if there is one
thing worse than a show axed before its
time, it's watching a once-great show
flounder to stay funny, dramatic or relevant, leaving audiences wondering
why the actors haven't yet left for
greener pastures and wishing that the
damned thing would just die already. In
fact, there are many examples of shows
that should have breathed their last
years ago still clinging to the airwaves,
riding on inexplicably high ratings or
unwillingness to part with a former
critical darling. In no particular order,
here are four shows that should be
allowed to slip away peacefully, as well
as two that look as if they're heading in
that direction.
Definitely Dead: "The Office." I
appreciate "The Office" as much as anyone. During its first seasons I found Jim
will-they-or-won't-they
and Pam's
endearing,

Dwight's

megalomania

hilarious and Michael's shenanigans
just awkward enough. Over the past
couple seasons, however, the formerly
adorable Jim and Pam have become
smug and the supporting characters
have refused to evolve, allowing their
defining quirks to become tired instead
of becoming more realistic.
The worst development, however,
has been the way that Michael's antics
have veered from delightfully awkward
to excruciatingly painful. Seriously,
how is Michael Scott promising college
scholarships to a group of underprivileged kids, only to go back on his word
in a humiliating and tragic fashion,
remotely funny? This "Office" should
have taken a cue from the British version and ended back when it was still
funny.
Definitely Dead: "Gossip Girl." I
will admit to having led this show's
cheering section a few times too many,
but in my defense, that was back when
the kids were still in high school and
the drama was still delicious. "Gossip
Girl" fell victim to the classic high
school-soap trap of losing its way when
the kids moved on to college.
Seriously, there is no way that

Blair's antics would in any way allow
her to rule a college campus the same
way she did Constance Billiard, and
Serena's liaisons with politicians and
professors are sad, not soapy. Not to

8

mention the abomination that is Jenny
Humphrey's hair and wardrobe. Guys,
there's a reason that Cecily von
Ziegesar's books end at graduation. '
Definitely Dead: "Entourage."
When this show first aired on HBO, it
was a wickedly funny satire of the business that is show business, featuring a
magnificent study in Hollywood excess
in the form of Jeremy Piven's blowhard
talent agent, Ari Gold. However, after
that the show started featuring guest
appearances by everyone from Scarlett
Johanssen to James Cameron to Sasha
Grey, and what began as a

mention that Tara's character became
even more offensively stereotyped, and
the pacing of the show stripped any suspense from the storytelling. Really, the
only reason that I still hold out hope
(and that I will
watch at least the
premiere of the
next season) is
w that the writers
of
"True
Hk..
Blood"

f

*

Tinseltown
became a self-congratulation
fest
filled with so many
in-jokes that you need to actually be a
part of Los Angeles culture to appreciate it. Which, news flash, most television viewers are not.
Definitely Dead: "House." When
"House" premiered in 2004, its combination of medical procedural and charismatic, curmudgeonly anti-hero, winningly played by Hugh Laurie, proved
to be critical and ratings gold. Seven
seasons in, however, the patient-of-theweek formula has long since gotten
stale, and efforts to shake up the show
by adding new cast members have generated nothing but ill will. Not to mention that this season's attempt to
demonstrate House's personal growth
by hooking him up with Cuddy has
turned the wounded loner into a loving,
stable boyfriend
a move that would
be lovely in real life, but which is
incredibly boring on television.
Who could have thought that stripping the show's title character of his
defining personality traits would harm
the story so much? Oh, wait...
Still Breathing: "True Blood." It
pains me to say this, but the most
recent season of True Blood sucked.
And not in a sexy, punny, sucks-yourblood way, but just good old-fashioned
sucking. Flaws that, in the first two seasons, were masked by the nonstop
action and sexy novelty of HBO's vampire hit appeared full force, derailing
the story with gaping plot holes and
character decisions clearly motivated
by where the story needed to go, not
what the characters would actually do.
Bill and Sookie's relationship
became even more unrealistic and
unhealthy, and some of the show's most
interesting characters, like Jason and
Lafayette, were wasted in dull sub-plots
unrelated to the main action. Not to

In the meantime, however, I would
recommend "The Vampire Diaries" for
your fang fix.
Still Breathing: "Glee." The pilot
of "Glee," which was released last June
to build anticipation for the series' run
in the fall, is an almost-perfect episode
of television, and the first half of the
musical hit's first season followed up
on that promise with a winning combination of snark, heart and catchy musical numbers.
As soon as the show came back from
its winter hiatus, however, it started to
seriously flounder, losing its edgy
satire and replacing it with implausible, after-school-special type Lessonwith-a-capital-L episodes, and stripping
many of its characters of any likeability they once had.
I hesitate to declare this show dead
so early in its run, and there have been
good episodes this season
the lovely,
understated (at least for "Glee")
"Duets" comes to mind
but they are
few and far between.
If this show wants to avoid becoming
a cautionary tale, it needs to scale back
on the heavy-handed moralizing and
bring back the fun.

You multitask. Shouldn't your money do the same?
swarthmorephoenix.com

A few years ago, I
walked into my local CVS
and saw a sale sign for
travel-sized tubes of toothpaste that read: SO.OL I did
a double-take, then instinctively looked toward the

Steve Dean
Life Tips from a Dean

fine print to determine
whether they limited you
to only one item per person. But there was no
printed limit. Still skeptical, I called a manager over
and verified that the price
was indeed one penny per
tube, and that I could pur-

chase as many tubes as I
wanted. The manager, to my astonishment, confirmed
this. I then proceeded to place every single bottle on the
rack into my basket, and left with 44 bottles of toothpaste
and a whopping bill of 44 cents. I saved $4312 (based on
the list price of travel-sized toothpaste at 99 cents/tube),
and did not have to purchase a single tube of toothpaste
for the entire duration of my college experience.
Experiences like this do not have to be few and far
between. Saving money (and making money, too!) can be
incredibly easy, if only you know a few tricks of the
trade. While on the topic of CVS, I'll have you know that
at the end of every product season, especially after major
holidays, CVS marks its excess merchandise down at
rates up to 90%. Are you addicted to $3.99 tubes of Burt's
Bees-style chapstick? Try stocking up when you see it on
sale for 39 cents a tube. And if you have a free CVS discount card, there are a number of items each week that
come with 100% rebates. That is, when you buy the item
for $lO, you get a coupon on your receipt for $lO that can
go toward anything else in the store. I'll happily admit
that, thanks to deals like this, I have been able to shave
with fancy electric vibrating razors for the past three
years without paying a dime.
While smallretail stores like CVS may offer incredible deals every now and then, I strongly caution you
against assuming that routine CVS shopping will save
you money in the long haul. Small scale retail stores
mark up their products painfully high, so a bottle of
shampoo you could get at Target for $5 will likely cost
you nearly double at a smaller retailer. Also, be very
mindful when getting your prescriptions at any retail
pharmacy. Many doctors routinely prescribe over-thecounter drugs like Tylenol or Zantac, and when you take
your prescription for sixty Tylenol tablets up to the pharmacy counter, the pharmacy staff will likely walk out
into the aisle and open up a 500-count bottle of Tylenol in
order to fill your prescription, and then charge you the
full retail price for your 60 tablets, which typically ends
up being roughly equivalent to the price of the larger bottle. I am a pharmacy technician
trust me, this does
happen. The net result here is that you pay the same
amount for 60 tablets as you could have paid for 500
tablets, had you simply acknowledged that your prescription was for an over-the-counter drug.
Let's carry these retail savings over to the realm of
online shopping. Before you even start looking for products online, download the browser extension Priceßlink.
It's a nifty little program that aggregates prices from
over 3,000 online merchants and informs you whether
the product you're viewing is cheaper elsewhere. It also
provides product reviews and site-specific
coupons that
you can use right at the checkout page. As for what products to buy, might I recommend something relatively
cheap that will save you money every week for the rest
of your life while reducing your ecological footprint to
boot? A drying rack! Consider that most Swatties probably spend about $3 per month on drying machines, which
over the course of a school year averages out to about
$25. If you instead invest that $25 in a sturdy chrome drying rack (Priceßlink will tell you where to get it), you can
begin saving $25-$35 a year for the rest of your life, all the
while eliminating a large component of your carbon footprint.

Enough with the buying let's talk about what not to
buy: software. A copy of Microsoft Office costs anywhere
from $99.99 $149.99. As for a copy of Open Office, which
offers virtually identical functionality: free. An account
with Google Docs, which extends that functionality to
-

the Internet so you can access all your office files from
anywhere in the world: also free.
For virtually every

THE PHOENIX

other type of software you might consider buying, I
merely recommend that you first check out Damicon's
List of Open Software, which provides direct links to
hundreds of open source software programs that you can
download for free.
Life is complicated, and sometimes saving money
here and there just isn't enough. We as humans like to
multitask, so why not extend that multitasking potential
to matters of money? I will close with three methods of
forcing your dollars to work every bit as hard as you do.
First, for all those dollars that are snoozing lazily in your
bank account, wake them up with a super saver or club
account at Franklin MintFederal Credit Union. Many, if
not most, Swatties already take advantage of at least one
of these sources of free money. Super saver accounts at
FMFCU earn 7% interest on the first $5OO, which means
that if you leave $5OO in that account, you are guaranteed
$35 every year. I personally call it my "send Steve to
Philadelphia Restaurant Week" fund. In addition, the
holiday and vacation E-Clubs at FMFCU each provide 3%
APY on your first $2,500, which could translate into
$75/year of free money, for each account, at no cost to you
whatsoever.
Secondly, consider selling some of your old things. I
had a TI-83 calculator from high school that I never
planned to use again. It collected dust in my room until I
decided to tap into the much-underappreciated power of
the Reserved Students Digest. When it comes to selling
things, the RSD makes life so deliriously easy. It immediately advertises your item to over a thousand potential

&

buyers, and in many cases you will have cash in your
hand within hours of your ad's publication. Also, don't
underestimate the power of Craigslist.com. For purchases of fairly expensive items, Craigslist can knock hundreds of dollars off of standard retail prices. Why get a
new dorm fridge at the store for $2OO when you can get
the exact same fridge on Craigslist for $5O?
My final piece of advice is to take five minutes to create a proxy email address, and then use it to sign up for
every member rewards program that you possibly can.
Rewards programs entail discounts, special offers, and
oftentimes free things. If you think getting gifts from
friends and relatives on your birthday is fun, try being
able to walk into any eating establishment and receive
free food/drinks that day simply because your name is on
one of their plastic cards. To be honest, you don't even
need the physical card itself. After five or six membership cards, your wallet starts to hate you anyway, so why
not head over to JustOneClubCard.com where you can
append the barcodes from most, if not all of your membership cards into one credit-card sized printout. Or if
you have an iPhone, simply download the CardStar app
that stores all of your club card barcodes for quick access
when you get to the register.
You work hard for your money, so it's about time that
you start making your money work hard for you. Here's
hoping that these tips will help keep that money in your
hands and under your control.

Triple feature Olde Club show explores electronica
BY SERA JEONG

sjeongl@swarthmore.edu
Saturday's "2 SOON" Olde Club performance will
feature a night of electronica, as house/dub band
Teengirl Fantasy, DJ and producer Brenmar and
local rock band Post Post take the stage.
Teengirl Fantasy is comprised of Logan Takahasi
and Nick Weiss, who formed the duo during their orientation week at Oberlin College. Their music brings
in elements of punk and house, a style of electronic
dance music. "We listen to all kinds of music, a lot of
house and dub, as well as experimental and classical," Takahasi and Weiss said in an e-mail.
Their new single "Dancing in Slow Motion" blends
synth and underground music styles with a flavor of
the 80s. Other tracks, such as "Portofino," sampled
from the original version of electronic music innovator Raymond Scott, feature a more dub influence.
Teengirl's music is versatile, producing a mix of stimulating and relaxing tracks. These qualities will help
draw a diverse crowd to Saturday night's show.
"Their live show will incorporate psycho-futuristic visualizations and dance-worthy beats that resist
classification," Blaine O'Neill 'll, Olde Club manager,
said.
Brooklyn-based DJ and producer Brenmar began
creating music in his early teens. Bill Salas' stage
name, Brenmar, comes from a nickname given to him
by his brother and is pronounced similarly to Bryn
Mawr. Brenmar balances elements of house, R&B,
hip hop and UK bass. Brenmar's combination of these
genres comes from his desire to produce dance-floor

friendly songs whilst being true to his love of hip hop
and R&B. Though Brenmar may be little known, his
songs sound largely familiar due to their remixing of
hit hip hop and R&B songs. "Back Beating" puts a
house/bass spin to Destiny's Child's 2004 hit

"Soldier."
"I'm far from the first, but I'd like to think I have
my own take on it," Brenmar said ofhis remixes.
Teengirl Fantasy and Brenmar are well acquainted, as Teengirl has played with Brenmar's band
These Are Powers before. Takashi and Weiss are
looking forward to "seeing Brenmar spin."
Performing after Teengirl is Post Post, a local indie
rock band formed from Tri-Co students Michelle
Zauner on vocals and guitar, Marisa Helgeson on

The city of Jerusalem lies at the heart
of the Arab-Israeli conflict. The city can
be divided into two parts, West and East,

the latter of which includes the walled
Old City, which in turn can be further
divided into four quarters. The Old City
contains four quarters; Christian,
Jewish, Muslim and Armenian. It also
houses the holiest sites of Christianity
and Judaism, as well as Islam's third
holiest site, after the cities ofMecca and
Medinah, which are so holy that nonMuslims are not allowed entry.

sometimes seems as though religious
authorities encourage the worship of the

No site, no matter how old, famous or
revered, should replace the practice of
these principles in any religious person's daily life.
Haifa, where I am studying, always
feels like a breath of fresh air after the
intensity of Jerusalem. There is a saying
about Israel that goes, "Jerusalem prays,
Tel Aviv plays and Haifa works." As dull
as that might make Haifa sound, it has
become my favorite city besides my
native city of San Francisco. Besides,
the "work" thing isn't so bad when you
can go swimming at the beach in

November.
Haifa also contains holy sites, especially for the Baha'i faith. Unlike the
crowded buildings of the Old City of
Jerusalem, the Baha'i maintain an enormous garden on the slopes of Mount
Carmel overlooking the Mediterranean.
Although I am not a Baha'i, the Baha'i
Gardens are my favorite religious site in
this region. Their tranquility and blend
of human-made and natural elements
are a stark contrast to the crowded Old
City, and they are a wonderful place for
contemplation.
That being said, I'm heading back to

Jerusalem this weekend for the second

time this month, and I already have
plans to spend Christmas there. For all
of its flaws, Jerusalem is an incredible

place. As long as one doesn't get too carried away like the monks of the Holy
Sepulchre or the crazier tourists, it is a
wonderful city to visit. I have no doubt
that it is a Holy City, and I hope that
some day all of its residents and faiths
will be treated with the same reverence
and respect that its religious sites
already receive.

Swat Style Snapshot
Name: Daniel (Grey Daniels) Niati
Year: 2012
From: Long Island, NY

Current Residence: Strath Haven
What He's Wearing:
As Niati explains below, his style has two moods: the
dressed up and the cozy and casual. For his sophisticated
look, pictured, Niati is wearing a blue button-down shirt
from LP, his khaki slim fit pants are D&G and his printed
scarf is from Urban Outfitters. His leather boots are by
the Italian brand Lavorazione Artigiana and his jacket is
by Shades of Greige, which is designed by Niati's friend
Micah Cohen and is sold at Urban Outfitters.
Though not pictured, Niati wanted to emphasize this
duality in his style, as he is regularly seen in more casual, comfortable looks. When interviewed, Niati was wearing a Willets shirt (though he's never lived there) and the
Swarthmore sweatpants and zip-up jacket. While sweatpants and sweatshirts are not the typical outfit choice for
the sartorially savvy, Niati dressed his casual look with
leather gloves, shoes from Chinese brand Roadposh, and
jewelry including a Buddhist charm bracelet and a necklace representing the Democratic Republic of Congo.
How He Describes His Personal Style:
"It's an eclectic mix," Niati said of his changing style.
"It really depends on my mood. When I'm depressed, I
dress really well. When I'm happy, I'm kind of comfortable." While some people work the opposite way, Niati
finds that his melancholy moods allow him to tap more
into his creative side. Rather than turning to sweatpants
and t-shirts while feeling down, Niati gravitates towards
"sleek and chic, avant garde and hip." "Fashion and clothing, it's really just for me. It's a personal tool for expression," he said.

Fashion Influences Inspirations:
"Fashion kind of runs in my blood," Niati said. His
great aunt designed for Versace and his sister was a runway model. Talk about a fashion forward family. "It's just
/

been kind of natural. It's been
ingrained in me
what looks
H
good, what doesn't."
Niati could be considered a citizen of the world, as he was born in
the Democratic Republic of the
Congo and has traveled through
Europe and China. Inspiration
comes from a variety of places, as
Niati enjoys shopping in China, Paris
and Italy. "To pinpoint my style, it
would have to be very European
chic and classic. I suppose also with an
Afro twist," he said.
Where He Shops:
Niati does not shop much while in

the United States for school. Besides
shopping in China, Niati likes menswear
from designers like Givenchy and Kris
Van Assche. Aside from these designers,
Niati also loves the aesthetic ofAlexander
McQueen and Philip Lim, who he worked
for as a public relations intern during Fall

2008. "He doesn't do men's clothing, it's
mainly female clothing, but it's really classic, clean lines," Niati said ofLim's designs.

Wardrobe Staples:
Niati offered up wardrobe staples for both
men and women. "For girls, you need to have
those pair of jeans that you feel great in along
with awesome heels to match," Niati said.
Isn't the perfect pair of jeans every girl's
dream?. As for guys, Niati advises a more
sophisticated look. "A nice fitted suit jacket,"
he said. "It's really hard to come by and once
you get it, keep it." A fitted jacket is also a staple that has made its way from men's closets to women's,
as the fitted blazer can sharpen up those perfect jeans and
heels.

One-act comedy creates introduction to theater
BY DINA ZINGARO

dzingarl@swarthmore.edu

In any theater production, to entertain and amuse
the audience poses a challenge. However, director
Abigail Henderson 'l4 and her cast of three succeeded in
their mere 10-minute-long one-act play "Playwriting 101:
The Rooftop Lesson."
Originally the Drama Board
a student committee
that funds productions outside the Theater Department
coupled Henderson's one-act with the "24 Hour
Theater Festival" on Friday night. Following the oneact, those interested would begin collaboration to write,
direct, and act in a play to be performed the following
Saturday evening. Due to a lack of participation, Drama
Board canceled the festival, but since the show must go
on, the cast of "Playwriting 101" still performed on both

evenings.

Written by Rich Orloff, the comedy opens on an
exchange between a jumper on the edge of a building
and a Good Samaritan trying to save her. Interrupting
the two characters' dialogue, a feisty and pretentious
theater instructor lectures on the craft of playwriting by
pausing and rewinding the scene with just the click of
her fingers. Yet, after being replayed too many times, the
two characters revolt against the instructor in the play's

humorous climax.

Along with its unique fusion of serious and comical
content, the one-act breaks the theatrical "fourth wall,"
which is the imaginary wall maintained at the front of
the stage between the actors onstage and the audience.
Often, for comedic or dramatic purposes, this boundary
is broken, and in "Playwriting 101," the teacher and
Good Samaritan break the wall when they address the
audience directly.

THE PHOENIX

About two weeks before opening night, Henderson
began rehearsing with actresses Michelle Ammerman
'l4 and Vianca Masucci 'l3, cast respectively as the
jumper and teacher. Later, Meghan Auker Becker 'll
joined the cast as the Good Samaritan. Without scenery
or props, the play afforded the cast more time to focus
primarily on character development.
No longer than about thirty minutes, comedic oneacts serve as short and poignant doses of laughter,
whereas much longer comedic plays can easily grow
monotonous. However, with the brevity of a one-act,
directors must work to guide actors to invest thoroughly in creating characters who appear real and believable. "[One-act characters] don't have the same backgrounds and detail as characters in full-length plays do,"
Henderson said.
Actors, with such little script material, are really
only exposed to one side of their character and thus, are
denied a generous amount of time for character building. In developing her sassy and melodramatic character, Masucci said, "I didn't get the chance to have that
'intimate alone time' with my character. It was still really fun, but trying to make my character distinct and an
individual in the short amount of time was a challenge."
Though, for first-time actresses like Becker, the
shortness of a one-act presents a less daunting challenge
for those trying their hand in performance art. Though
Becker considers her acting career as both beginning
and ending with "Playwriting 101," she enjoyed the
opportunity to disengage from reality during rehearsals.
"You didn't have to think about schoolwork or about
your personal drama. Part of the requirement was that
you had to get into that character and it was nice to be
able to detach from the real world," Becker said.
In considering her cast's various strengths,

November 18, 2010

Henderson commendedBecker for her impressive range
of sincere facial expressions during a specific segment
when she actually has no lines. "When actors aren't
delivering lines, they don't thinking anyone is looking
at them, so they just sit there and stare off into the distance. It's really important to stay in character the
whole time," Henderson said. For Becker, she expressed
the need to find a balance between remaining engaged
and not upstaging the central action. Her facial expressions, though subtle, did the job and satisfied
Henderson's philosophy of "letting your face be like
your whole body for that moment."
Drama Board member Alexandra Kreindler HuberWeiss 13 said, "One acts are also good for budding directors, because they give them a taste of directing, but they
don't have to take on the huge weight of a full length
play." Under Henderson's direction, Masucci admired
the creative energy, along with her perfect dosage of
patience. "As a director, you need to be patient, but not
too patient because you have to give actors a push in the
right direction," Masucci said.
While directing, Henderson loves vicariously living
each character through the actors. In rehearsals, her
own vision for each character fuses with the "flavor" of
each actor. "Even though, I had this character pictured
in my mind, the actor will do something and I'll be like
'that wasn't how I picture it, but that was really cool,'"
Henderson said.
As a theater major, Masucci treasures the distinctive
ever-changing nature of performance arts. Whereas a
painting is completed and then exhibited, Masucci feels
her performance transforms each time because "we are
different people in every second." She said, "The performance moves with you, it's not stoic. It lives and it
breathes, just like you do."

Civil liberties still vital during travel, even with challenges
Preparing to board a flight out of San
Diego last Saturday, John Tyner made a

choice that many travellers may make
go through a full-body
scanner.
As per protocol, a TSA agent then
instructed Tyner that he would need to go
through an extensive body pat down, and
he resisted yet again, saying he would only
go through a metal detector. "If you touch
my junk, I'll have you arrested," he bluntly told the TSA agent, asserting that he
would not submit to what he considered
sexual assault.
He then did not board the plane and
was refunded the price of the ticket. Tyner
recorded the encounter on his phone, and
this week that video and his ensuing blog
posts have become viral.
He's not alone in his resistance to
recently introduced airport security methods.

Americans support full-body scanners at
airports, according to a CBS News poll
released earlier this week.
November 24, the set date for "opting

take some kind of stand or make some concrete sacrifice (like Tyner not getting on
his plane) and if the government will listen.
Perhaps Tyner's stance seems childish.
But he has, in part, helped begin questioning security measures that need to be

questioned and should be thoroughly evaluated.
A healthy degree of skepticism is not
the enemy in a culture that needs to
embrace informed decisions and democratic values more than ever.
The shift in airport security toward
full-body scanners is in theory a necessary
one, but it shouldn't become the norm
without some opposition.
We cannot forget that, even in the face
of security threats, Americans still
deserve civil liberties.

Opposing abortion is the only real moral choice

swarthmorephoenix.com

When you think of
social conservatism today,
there is one position you
expect every social conserto take: opposition
to abortion. The reason for
this is complicated but gets
to the heart of why I am a
social conservative.
I have opposed abortion

procedure was. I recognize

argue that while they may
not morally agree with the
procedure or ever want to choose to have an abortion, it is a legal right for women to choose if they
should have an abortion, no matter how immoral
ending the potential life of a human is.
I come to a different conclusion when it comes to
abortion: not only do I oppose it on moral grounds, I
also believe the government should restrict abortion
to be only used in cases of rape or severe danger to
the mother's life. This is a typical pro-life stance
today, which I am not sure everyone understands.
In fact, this is the stance taken by Senator John
McCain (R-Ariz,), former Massachusetts Governor
Mitt Romney and many other prominent
Republicans. Former Republican Vice Presidential
nominee Sarah Palin even goes as far to say that
abortion should be permitted when there is the potential for severe danger to the mother's life.
One comment I get on my abortion stance is often
that I call myself "pro-life." I am actually willing to
concede that the word "life" is prejudicial. I am willing to call myself anti-abortion because abortion
denies life in my mind, so the terms don't matter.

My friend from Morehouse College,

doesn't think I should be the slightest bit
concerned about my post-Swat prospects,

He repeatedly argues that our twenties
are a time for self-exploration. To him, the
idea of being committed to one person at a
young age is detrimental to our development as young adults. There is too much
he wants to do with his life to have any
attachments. I find his reasoning flawed.
It seems quite silly to me that one would
wake up at 35 and decide it was all of a

themselves.
I can't help but admire the path of my
20-year-old friend and Swattie who will be
getting married in January. She will avoid
the long arduous process of trial and error
and heartbreak that so many of us will
have to engage in after Swarthmore.
As my friend logically pointed out,
"What if you meet someone after Swat on
like the street or something. They could be
a serial killer."
So if you see me with my head down
and my iPod on, I'm over here stressing
up a storm, giving the mean side eye to
this adorable freshman couple on my hall.
I have a lot of work to do and I have no
idea what I'm doing next year. All I know
is I won't be here. I suggest you don't ask
any of the seniors about their plans.
For now, no news means we are surviving and if it's great hews, we will gladly relay the message.

Penalties doom Garnet; Swarthmore finishes 16-1-4
BY VICTOR BRADY
vbradyl@swarthmore.edu

For the second consecutive year,
the Swarthmore Garnet men's soccer
season ended with an official tie, a
result that hardly seems fitting after
the Garnet's dominance this season.

playoff
Swarthmore and the DeSales Bulldogs
matching each other through the first
89 minutes of play.
With 960 fans in attendance and
nearly that many watching online,
sophomore Kieran Reichert connected on a blast from the top of the box,
burying the ball inside the near post
out of the reach of a diving Adam
Franczak to give the Garnet a 1-0 lead.
But the Bulldogs responded 17 minutes into the second half, when off a
throw-in, Jonathan Balfour headed
the ball over Swarthmore keeper
David D'Annunzio to knot the match
at one.
With the game seemingly headed to
overtime, Langley ran onto a ball in
the left corner and laid a beautiful
ball across the box to the foot of
Fabian Castro 'l2, who touched it
under Franczak with 47 seconds to go,
setting off a raucous celebration and
propelling the Garnet into the second
round of the NCAA tournament for
the third consecutive season.
"The energy level that our fans
bring to us is one of the most important things that we have, and that is
why we've felt, from day one, that
playing at home in November was
such a big goal for us," head coach
Eric Wagner said.
For Langley, it was the final assist
of his stellar career, in which he
became the Garnet's all-time leading
scorer.
The win set up a second round
matchup with Medaille, which defeated Rochester 1-0 in the opening round
of the tournament.
Swarthmore
dominated
the
Mavericks in nearly every facet of the
game, controlling possession, getting
clear chances on goal and outshooting
Medaille 17-12 through regulation, but
Swarthmore failed to find the back of
the net, sending the game into overtime.
After playing even through the
first overtime period, Swarthmore
completely controlled the second
overtime, outshooting Medaille 7-1 in
the final ten minutes of play. The best
chance for the Garnet came off a

on Sunday and we leave the tourna-

ment knowing that."

Sunday marked the end of the stellar careers of Langley, Newman, and
Philippe Celestin 'll, whose contributions to the program in the past four
are too numerous to count.
Langley terrorized the Centennial
Conference in each of the past two
seasons, finishing his senior year
fifth in the country in total points and
fourth in total assists.
Newman was the anchor of a
defense that finished in the top-30
nationally in goals against average in
each of the past three years.
Celestin scored two of the biggest
goals in recent program history, the
game-winner against Hobart in the
second round of the 2009 NCAA tour
nament and the game-tier against
Johns Hopkins in the Centennial
semifinal this year.
The Garnet will need to regroup
offensively
next year without
Langley, who accounted for 28 of the
team's 48 goals this season (14 goals
and 14 assists) and whose speed and
creative touch on the ball was nearly
impossible to defend.
"Morgan will be greatly missed: as
a goalscorer, a teammate, but most of
all, as a friend," said Maqami. "We
have great strikers on this team who
are more than ready to make up for
those 28 goals. The style of play will
have to adjust because Morgan has a
lot of pace and a great deal of technical ability, but we will be even more
dominant next season."

For the women, Hannah Rose 'l2 and
Emma Saarel 'l4 led the team to the sev-

enth-place finish. Rose and Saarel were
named All-Region performers, finishing
22nd (23:12) and 34th (23:341) respectively in the 6K race.
Rebecca Woo 'll placed 39th with a
time of 23:40.2, missing All-Region honors by only five seconds. Rounding out
the scoring for the Garnet were Isabel
Newlin 13 (24:47.5) with an 89th-place
finish and Caitlin Russell 'll (24:481)
with a 90th-place finish.
On the men's side, sophomores John
McMinn and Jacob Phillips once again
led the team. McMinn finished first for
the Garnet in the 8K race with a time of
26:47.3 for 62nd place. Phillips followed
behind McMinn for 76th place with a
time of 27:08.
Rounding out the top five for the
Garnet men were Aidan DumontMcCaffrey 'l3 (27:341) in 102nd place,

Chris Wickham 'l2 (27:52.7) in 124th
place and BUI King 'l3 (28:07.5) in 140th
place.
It was a disappointing finish for the
men, whose goal was to reach top ten in
the region. The men's team has high
hopes for next season as the team is predominantly composed of first-years and
sophomores.
"We've been performing better this
season than [we did] at Regionals,"
Chris Wickham 'l2 said about the team's
17th place finish on Saturday.
But despite the finish at regionals,
this season has seen improvements for
the cross country team and Wickham
was proud of the team cooperation and
camaraderie.
"This season has seen more of us
pushing each other. I hope this continues, that [there is] more working together than [everyone] doing their own
thing."

One of the ways the team is trying to
improve is by getting more of the runners to finish together; this means team
cooperation is a high priority for the
next season.

Men's swim team crushes F&M, first time in 22 meets
BY ANA APOSTOLERIS
aapostol@swarthmore.edu

Swarthmore athletics are never about
fear, intimidation or surrender, especially
not when all the pieces are in place for an
underdog upset. After years of playing
second fiddle in the Centennial
Conference, the undefeated men's swim
team (3-0,2-0 CC) took a giant step towards
its goal of eventually wearing the name
"champion" on Saturday as it dismantled
the Franklin & Marshall Diplomats by a
129-70 final.
The Garnet win snapped F&M's 22meet Conference winning streak and also
made an strong statement to the winners
of the last six Conference championships;
it won't be so easy this year.
"[The men] swam out of their minds,"
said temporary head coach Casmera
Wick, who is leading the team until Sue
Davis returns from sabbatical. "I had a
feeling we were going to win, but I didn't
know it would be this big."
"Depth" was the word of the day, as
Swarthmore men recorded the top time in
nine of 11 events. The Garnet came out firing on all cylinders, as the "A" 400-yard
medley relay team, consisting of sophomore Roger Chin (backstroke), senior
Sterling Satterfield (breaststroke), sophomore Daniel Duncan (butterfly), and junior Tim Brevart (freestyle) touched first
in a fast 3:43.29 to open the meet. Directly
behind them followed the Swat "B" team,
as junior Sam Bullard-Sisken (backstroke), junior Lance Liu (breaststroke),
sophomore Charlie Hepper (butterfly),
and senior Santiago Lombo (free) teamed
up for a 3:45.96. By the time the waters
had cleared from the first event,
Swarthmore had already built up a 15-4
lead and never looked back.
Continuing the distance dominance
that has come to characterize the 2010-11
men's team, the Garnet swept the 1000yard freestyle, as sophomore Josh Satre
(10:08.39) recorded his third win in the
event in as many meets. He was followed
by sophomore Tyler Hanson (10:19.51) and
freshman Brian Nadel (10:27.45). Satre's
time is a full nine seconds faster than his
personal best from last season and he
projects to be a major factor at
Centennials in his events, as he also took
the 500 in Saturday's meet (4:55.98) to
remain undefeated in distance races on
the season.
"He's just improved constantly since
he started swimming here," Wick said in
praise of her breakout sophomore. "Last
year, we saw lifetime best [after] lifetime
best and that's just continued this sea-

son."
The men proceeded to take the top two
spots in the next four events. Duncan
(1:47.93) and sophomore Jake Benveniste
(1:5117) bested the field in the 200 free, and
Brevart (2L99) and Lombo (23.03) followed
up with one-two touches in the 50. Firstyear Stan Le (2:03.76) and Hepper (2:04.41)
teamed up to dominate the 200 IM, and
Duncan and Hepper returned in the very
next event to record the top times in the
200 fly (2:00.47 and 2:01.96, respectively).
By the time the 500 freestyle rolled
around, the Garnet was a mere four
points away from clinching the victory.
This was accomplished in characteristically outstanding fashion, as Satre,
Hanson (5:02.71) and Benveniste (5:03.00)
swept the top three places to give
Swarthmore the victory and, for the time
being, status as the team to beat in the

conference.
The significance of the rivalry was not
lost on any of the Garnet swimmers going

Backstroker John Flaherty competes in Saturday's Dual Meet with Franklin
into Saturday. "Even though I'm a freshman, I came in knowing that F&M had
been beating us at conferences for the past
few years. Everyone knows about the
rivalry.
Our coach had constantly
reminded us that F&M was most likely
our toughest competition, and the win
today was huge," Le said.
Veterans Brevart and Satterfield echo
Le's sentiment. "F&M has always been a
powerhouse
Centennial
in
the
Conference, and to us, they have always
been the team to beat," Brevart said.
"The last time F&M lost a conference
dual meet was
in 2006. Never before in
our program's history have we managed
to outscore them by as much as we did, so
the win is a very positive indication of
how we will compete against the other
conference teams as well as at the championship meet," he added.
"We took out who we thought would be
our biggest competition with relative
ease, so this win gives us tons of momentum moving forward in the season," said
Satterfield.
If this is the case, the individual performances on Saturday were enough to
render any Garnet fan optimistic.
Brevart, a finalist in both sprint freestyle
events at last year's championships, posted his first sub-22 second 50 of the season
on Saturday
an impressive mark for
such an early point in the year. Obviously
enthusiastic about his results thus far, he
said, "This has been my best season yet
since I began swimming competitively... .1
think the times I've been putting up so far
are a reflection of the work I did this summer, so hopefully they will continue to
drop as they have. By the time we taper
for conferences, I'm hoping to break our
school's 50 and 100 freestyle records,
which would also mean a trip to the
NCAA championship in March of 201L"

Diplomats] wasn't my best, but I'm feeling

the season is only three meets old, his
time in the 200IM was fast enough to have
placed him in the top 16 at last year's
championships. In light of his significant
scoring haul in his first introduction to
the rivalry, Le remains modest about his
season and temperate in terms of looking
ahead. "Hopefully I'll keep on improving," he says, "but it's a bit early in the
season to make any predictions."

The Garnet women did not bode as well
as the men in terms of overall performance, finding themselves on the wrong
end of a 127-78 decision to the reigning
champions. But in regards to the performance of the freshman class, women's
swimming too has much to be excited
about.
Swarthmore's leading point scorers in
the women's meet were both members of
the class of 2014, as Erin Lowe and Becky
Teng continued their rookie runs on the
conference. Both won two individual
events apiece and contributed to the second-place 400 medley relay. Lowe came
out victorious in the 200 free (2:0115) and
200 fly (2:14.52), while Teng won the 200 IM
(2:14.99) and the 200 breaststroke (2:31.28).
"We have some very talented [firstyears]," Coach Wick said of her women,
"especially [Lowe] and [Teng]. [Fellow
first-year] Maggie Regan is also a very
well-rounded swimmer."
Wick attributes Saturday's loss to matters of matchups and focus. "I think that
when we get to Ursinus, [the Garnet's next

November 18, 201(5

Conference competitor], the focus will be
back in place for the women."
It could be argued that this men's dual
meet victory is the most exciting thing to
happen to Swarthmore swimming in
years. As exciting as the win was in
terms of point totals, what was even more
impressive was the sheer number of individual Swarthmore swimmers who
turned in winning performances.
"We have a lot of very talented swimmers who are great not only in their
events, but in a lot of different events,"
said Wick of the men's team. In a testament to the depth of the squad, five different swimmers took first place in individual events. Three others recorded secondplace finishes. In a championship format
that values a team's ability to put multiple
point-scorers in each event, this roster
construction bodes extremely well for the
Garnet. Even in a purely short-term
sense, Saturday's victory can be described
as nothing short of spectacular.
"The win was huge," beamed Brevart.
"After three wins already, we remain
undefeated, and beating the [Diplomats]
definitely has everyone in great spirits
and good confidence."
"We didn't just win either, it was more
or less a domination," added Le. "This
was a huge boost for morale. ...Hopefully,
this win will serve to drive us to even
greater heights.

"

"Everything was perfect on Saturday;
the team was excited, ready to race, and
ready to win," said Satterfield. "There
was tons of energy in the building, and if
we can keep that going it's going to be an
incredible season."
The Garnet will head on the road to the
Rowan Invite on Saturday, where action
begins at 9 a.m. The,team then travels to
Ursinus for the third Centennial dual
meet of the year on Tuesday. The head-tohead with the Bears is set to begin at 6
p.m.

Volleyball falls in ECAC semis to end 20-win year
swarthmorephoenix.com

BY VICTOR BRADY
vbradyl@swarthmore.edu
Having secured their first 20-win

season since the formation of the
Centennial Conference in 1992, the second-seeded Swarthmore volleyball
team dropped a heartbreaker to
Bethany (WV) in the semifinals of the
ECAC South championship.
Swarthmore took the opening two
sets in the match played in Latrobe, PA
by scores of 25-18 and 25-19 respectively. But Bethany fired back, winning a
close third set 25-23 before taking control of the final two sets 25-20 and 15-7.
Third-seed Bethany went on to
defeat top-seed St. Vincent for the title.
Kat Montemurro 'l3 led four Garnet
players with double-digit kills. She
recorded 16 and Danielle Sullivan 'l4
provided 14 to pace the Swarthmore
attack. Maggie Duszyk 'l4 and Genny
Pezzola 'l2 supported the attack with 12
and 11 kills respectively.
Playing in her first match since
being named to the first team AllCentennial for the second year in a
row, Pezzola also recorded 13 digs
against Bethany, third on the team
behind Sullivan (16) and Hillary
Santana, a second team All-Centennial
selection, who had 14.
Montemurro joined Santana on the
second team All-Centennial. It is her
second selection in her two years at
Swarthmore. The three players selected to the All-Centennial teams are the
most in program history.
The loss ended a year which saw the
Garnet set numerous program records
and reach the Centennial Conference
finals for the first time in program

history.
Swarthmore defeated Gettysburg
for the first time ever, and then beat
the Bullets again in the postseason to
reach the Centennial semifinalsfor the
second consecutive year.

Swarthmore avenged a regular season
loss and a 2009 Centennial defeat with
a thrilling five sets victory to dethrone

the four-time defending Centennial

champions and earn a spot opposite

Franklin & Marshall in the Centennial
final match.
Head coach Harleigh Chwastyk was
also named Centennial Conference coach
of the year for the second consecutive
season.
"We learned this season that when
we set a goal, we can accomplish it,"
said Chwastyk, whose team accomplished the goal of knocking off
Haverford and fell just short of winning the Centennial Conference.
"When we are focused, we can play
really, really well, and when we are
challenged, we can work to recover
from mistakes," Chwastyk added.
Allie Coleman 'l3, who established
herself as one of the top setters in the
Centennial with a breakout sophomore
season, believes that the team has the
talent to contend for a title next year.
"We learned that we have the potential to be a championship quality team,
but also that just having the the ability
is not enough to actually win a championship. We need to be able to play at
a high level for every single set of
every single game if we want to be a
team that actually performs to our
potential," Coleman said.
Coleman recorded 919 assists this
year, the third-most ever in a single
season in team history.
The Garnet will return all but one
player next season, Sarah Lambert 'll,
who ends her career with 134 service
aces.
A key for the Garnet to continue to
improve is the development of a "killer
instinct," the ability to end matches
after taking the lead.
"That was a topic that coach talked
to us a lot about and I'm not sure if we
really figured it out," Duszyk said.
"I think the team will develop more
of a killer instinct as the seasons go on.
We are an improving program and,
from what I've gathered as a freshman,
seem to have more confidence with
every passing season," she added.
Pezzola, who finished second on the

GARNET IN ACTION

team in kills and digs, wants to see the

team become mentally tougher.

"I think we improved mentally dur-

ing the year. As the season progressed

we played more and more for the love
of the game and for each other, and I
think that showed in our performance," Pezzola said.
"It will take a continual improvement on our mental game to get better
next year. A consistent killer instinct
needs to be developed in each player
in order to get where we would like to
be," Pezzola added.
With her 328 kills this year, Pezzola
eclipsed the 1,000-kill mark for her
career.
Montemurro led the team with 332
kills and has 594 through her first two

SPORTS IN BRIEF

Despite loss, women strong in opener
The Swarthmore Garnet women's
basketball team opened the 2010 in
convincing fashion, falling to the
Widener Pride by a score of 73-62.
The Garnet built up a 19 point
lead with 4:26 to go in the first half
of play before Widener went on a
run to cut the deficit to just nine at
halftime.
In the first half, Swarthmore was
led by Kathryn Stockbower 'll, who
scored 11 points and pulled down
seven rebounds.
But Stockbower was far from the
only offensive presence for the
Garnet, who shot 60% from the floor
in the first half.
Eliza Polli 13 scored seven points
off a three, a lefty layup, and a pullup from inside the arc, while Ceylon
Bodur 'll also added seven off of two
driving layups and a spot-up three.
But turnovers plagued the Garnet
down the stretch in the half. The
team committed nine in the first

half, including one with five seconds
to go in the half that led to a
Widener driving layup, shifting
momentum to the Pride at the break.
Widener came out firing after
halftime, outscoring Swarthmore 4322 after halftime to win the game
and drop the Garnet to 0-1 on the
year.

Stockbower finished with the
54th double-double of her career,
recording 16points and 13 rebounds.
Bodur finished with 15 points and
Polli with 12.
First year Ginny LaFauci 'l4 contributed seven rebounds for the
Garnet.

The pride of Swat: men upset Widener in opener
to be a playoff team. We're looking for-

BY DANIEL DUNCAN
dduncanl@swarthmore.edu

After making strides last season,
the Swarthmore men's basketball
team is already off to its best start in
recent years. The Garnet (1-0) won
their season opener for the first time
since 2007 on Monday against Widener
(0-1) 74-72.

The Garnet played excellent basketball, showing many improvements
from the 2009-10 edition of the team.
The talented freshman class made a
strong debut while upperclassmen displayed their leadership and skills.
Despite shooting just 34.3% from the
floor last season, the Garnet still more
than doubled their win total from the
season before. This year they look to
improve on that total yet again.
In order to do so, the team needs to
improve not only on offense but
defense as well. Defense was what
kept the Garnet in games last year,
and Ryan Carmichael 'll, who locked
down Widener's senior guard Chris
McDevitt, feels this year's team is
even stronger on the defensive end of
