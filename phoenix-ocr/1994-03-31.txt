Students and Staff Discuss
Hazardous Waste Disposal
By Kate Ehrenfeld
Seven members of Swarthmore's student recycling crews met
on Tuesday, March 29th with C.
Stuart Hain, the director of Construction and and Plant Management, and Jeff Jabco, director of
Grounds. They discussed the need
for an adequate program for the
legal and environmentally-safe disposal of hazardous wastes generated by the college campus.
Household hazardous wastes,
including paint products, automotive products, household cleaners
and fluorescent light bulbs, are currently mixed with Swarthmore's
non-hazardous waste. Together they
are trucked to the Westinghouse incinerator in Chester.
The incineration of these materials creates an environmental hazard for Swarthmore and all other
communities surrounding the
Westinghouse plant. The fumes
which they emit while burning are
highly toxic. Environmentally superior processing of these wastes
wouldinvolve transporting them to
a different facility where they could
be burned at a temperature 1000
degrees higher than that of
Westinghouse. Under such circumstances, they would be monitored
24 hours a day.
The student recyclers present
at the meeting, Lisa Mosca, Maria
Barker, Doug Watson, Russ Stark,
Kate Ehrenfeld, Laura Ascenzi, and

Kate Atkins, proposed the construction of a shed in which hazardous
campus wastes could be stored before periodic trips to a plant designed to dispose ofdangerousproducts. They also mentioned the need
for a shed to store plastics, large
food cans, and paperboard, items
that are collected by the recycling
crews. These materials can be disposed of either at the recycling collection points in The Ville or in the
lot behind DuPont.
In response to this idea, Hain
suggested that large bins for the
collectionof plastics, food cans and
paperboard be placed at one site on
campus. From this point, they could
be hauledby a private contractor to
Femwood, where they can be recycled.
In reference to the issue ofhazardous wastes, Hain suggested that
recyclers could gain access to the
hazardous waste shed already in
place for the use ofmembers of the
Biology and Chemistry departments.

When asked about the volume
ofhazardous waste being generated
by the campus, Jabco informed the
student group thatSwarthmore College is a national leader in the field
of Integrated Pest Management. It
is one of the few institutions in the
country which manages to maintain
its grounds with so little pesticide
and herbicide. Helpful insects and
environmentally safe chemicals are
used instead, resulting in a dimin-

ished waste problem.
Hain added that household
cleaners used in the dorms are also
as ecologically sound as possible,
being close to neutral in pH, and
phosphate-free. Academic chemical experimentsperformed oncampus, painting projects, the upkeep
of campus vehicles, the batteries
of flashlights used by B&G workers and security officers, and countless other sources, however, do
generate wastes that cannot be
burned in the Westinghouse incinerator, and require separate collection and storage. For this reason,
work on the implementation of a
collection strategy will be started
immediately.
Also discussed at the meeting
w as theneedfor a new programfor
the collection of corrugated cardboard. Since the cardboard must,
by law, be recycled, students
stressed the need for an alternate
methodofcollection to the current
practice of "dumpster-diving,"
which consists of fishing it out of
garbage dumpsters.
The meeting ended with a discussion of the efforts that could be
made by SwarthmoreCollegecommunity members to reduce the
amount of waste that we send to
the incinerator. These measures include reducing consumption of
highly packaged products, carefully sorting objects to be recycled,
and reusing paper and other products before tossing them away.

By Tamar Charry
"How many of you," asked
movie critic and social commentator Michael Medved of the
eighty-odd students and community members gathered in the
Friends' Meetinghouse last Thursday, "have ever witnessed a live
murder?" The room was silent,
and not a hand was raised. He
nodded. "Neither have I, thank
God. Now, how many ofyou have
ever witnessed a murder on TV?"
About eighty hands went up. He
nodded again.
Medved was the fifth guest
speaker in a series of lectures
sponsoredby the SwarthmoreConservative Union and the Young
America's Foundation. Medved
currently hosts PBS' movie review show Sneak Previews, reviews for theNew York Post, and
has authored several books, including, most recently, Hollywood
vs. America Through its unrealistic depiction of sex and violence,
and its derision of traditional values and religion, he asserts, television is damaging the moral fiber
ofAmerican society. He perceives
a pressing threat in the fact that
"media influences redefine the
definitionof what's desirable, acceptable, chic, and expected in the
society."
In his lecture, "Hollywood's
Three Big Lies About Media and
Society," Medved outlined and
then disproved the arguments by
which the entertainment industry
attempts to justify itself. Itclaims
that: (a) The media does not influence people but only entertains
them; b) The media does not create social standards but instead
reflects them; and c) If people
don' t like what'sbeing shown, they
can avoid it by not watching.
First, Medved asserted that it
is a self-contradiction for television to claim that it is not an enormously influential force. We are
affected by what we watch, to be
sure. "How could popular culture
no/have a profound effect on soci.

ety when by the end of high school,
the average child has spent more
time watching television than he
has in school?" And furthermore,
since the advertising upon which
the entire industry depends is, by
definition, an attempt to influence
viewers, it would be impossible for
television to survive as "simple
entertainment."
That is, imagine a violent
show—say, a children's show, HeMan. And imagine that the network
books advertising for, say, toothpaste, during the show. Now, toothpaste will generally not hurt a child's
sense of morality. Yet the fact that
the child is watching this 30-second
clip implies thatheis also watching
characters being brutalized during
the regular program. If he is influenced by toothpaste, he is influenced even more by the portrayal of
murder.
He next asserted thattelevision
does not accurately reflect society,
as it claims. To illustrate this, he
discussed the depiction of sex on
TV. Again, he consulted the audience: "According to three national
surveys, what percentage ofAmerican adults do you think have more
than- one sexual partner during the
course of a year?"We offered answers of 10% and 80%. "The answer," he told the audience with
emphasis, "is 4% for two surveys,
6% for the other. And," he continued, "less than 15% have ever had
sexual relations outside of marriage." Yet extramarital affairs are
often expected of television characters.

These unrealistic portrayals actually create societal values. "I really believe," said Medved with
concern, "that this creates in the
mind of the people... a sense of
sexual entitlement" which can destroy self-image, personal stability,
and family structure. And this brings
us back to the threat posed to the
young: "We are sending out a message to children that if you don't
take part in all this joyous sexuality,
you're a nerd or a loser. It's just not

Finally, he demonstrated the
pervasiveness of the influence of
the media's created reality. "How
manyof you," he asked, "profess to
be Madonna fans?" With a grin he
added, "I know this is Swarthmore,
so this may be a dangerous question." A few people raised their
hands. "How many of you have
bought analbum ofhers?Howmany

the same few hands remained up.
"OK. Now, how manyofyou know
whoMadonna is?" Every hand went
up. He jumped on his newest piece
of anti-Hollywood evidence.
"That'sright! All ofyouknow who
Madonna is, even if you don't care!
I wonder if there's anyone in this
entire country who doesn't know
who Madonna is!"
He likened the proposition
that we shutit out by turning off our
TVs to saying, "Well, if you don't
like the smog, just stop breathing,"
which is impossible. "Do you think
that peoplehad a choiceaboutlearning about Lorena Bobbitt?" The
influence ofthe media is absolutely
everywhere.
In this way, Medved decried
the way in which we as Americans
are constantly confronted by the
harmful impact of the portrayal of
voilence and sex in the media. And
he asserts that we must insulate
ourselves against it by identifying
and critiquing the media voices
whichenter our lives. Not only does
this strengthen our own moral integrity, it creates a broad circle of
resistance against the effects. Says
Medved, "Everybody here has a
chance to make a contribution to
changing this in the society and in
your own lives. TV is the acid that
eats the soul. The only way to stop
the lies is to be the truth—to talk
thetruth and to live the truth."

Reactionary Students Mishandle Alex Juhasz Situation
To the Editor:

I was annoyed by those signs that appeared everywherejust before break, the ones
claiming that a great injustice had been done
to Alex Juhasz. Some of them did not even
mention her name, or any specific 'problem.'
This was offensive because it presupposed
thateveryone wouldknow what was going on
with the English department.
The English department is not the center
of the world. Contrary to popular belief, it is
not even the center of S w arthmore College. I
do not think it should be the center of anything, even my attention. I know I'm going to
win a lot of loyal English major friends with
this piece. Well, I've managed to get through
four years here without taking a single English course and I'm mighty proud of it. I
dislike the English department, and I'm getting out of here in a few months, so I can
finally say it and perhaps remain relatively
unscathed.
So why am I writing? Well, I was forced
to look at those signs, since they were everywhere. Then I received that unwanted e-mail
petition urging me to tell my opinions to Al
Bloom. I do not have an opinion about
whether Alex should have been hired or not.
I do have an opinion about how the students
reacted.
First, I thinkthe signs were incorrect and
in poor taste. It is not correct to say that Alex

"has unanimous student support" as one sign
claimed. She cannot possibly have unanimous student support, because I do not support her. I do not know anything about her.
I'm neither for nor against her, and I'm
certainly not just going to jump on the AntiAdministrationbandwagon because a bunch
ofother students are upset. Impossible as it
must seem to the Alex groupies, some on this
campus have never even met Alex.
Since the signs made one obviously
false claim, the others, such as that Alex has
"out published the rest of her department"
are thereforesuspect. The idea that Alex was
"put out of a job"because she has "rocked the
boat a little too much around here" appeals to
knee-jerks who think anyone who is not
hired is being discriminated against.
Next, the signs and the petition wanted
me to e-mail Al BloomandJennieKeith with
my disgust and righteous indignation. Now,
wait a minute. Who made the hiring decision? The English department. These decisions must be approved by the Provost and
President, but the responsibility lies with
English faculty. If one can prove that the
English department acted wrongly or engaged in improperprocedures, thenAlex has
my heartfelt sympathy. Then Al and Jennie
should takeaction to correct the problem and
prevent further abuses of power. Unless that
is the case, it is an intra-departmental problem and the students should approach Craig
Williamsonabout it insteadof trying to insti-

Editors: Put-up or Shut-up!
To the Editor:

Every reader should think twice about
this Phoenix that he or she is reading and
question the recent rise of this paper from its
ashes. Adam Preset, in the headline article
presumes that Swarthmore students are as
excited as he is that we "will no longer have
to dowithout our esteemed newspaper," which
is soon to receive course credit.
I, for one, did not miss the Phoenix and
found the alternative publications to be a
welcome change. In the true spirit of extracurricular activity, the editors of "Spike" and
other publications seized the opportunity to
explore their interest in publication. Taking
the initiative and seeking school funding,
they produced the magazine they had envisioned on their own time and with their own
commitment. And to think the editors of the
Phoenix did not publish issues because they
wanted to be paid.
Behind editors Andy Perrin and Jonathan
Seitz request for compensation is a complaint
about the time involved in editing a newspaper, a commitment no one asked them to take
on— "Spike" and others will pick up the
slack. The Phoenix editors wanted to be paid
for their time, though suggested they would
be satisfied with a deal made for academic
credit. If timeis the issue (and moneydoes not
reduce that), should student actors or captains
of athletic teams be compensated for their
additional time commitment? What about

other extracurriculars—named so for a reason—should they all receive compensation?
EvenPerrinand Seitz recognize thatcompensation would jeopardize the "journalistic integrity" of their extracurricular activity; and I
question what it says about their motives.
Perrin and Seitz bemoan that "staff is
always short," and "no one was interested in
editing." In fact, "the paper nearly died for
lack ofcandidatesfor Editorin-Chief." Is this
not an indication of the level ofinterest in the
Phoenix on campus? Why must we have a
newspaper when it seems more interest has
been generated by the diverse, and truly extracurricular, alternative publications?
Seeking credit or money for extracurricular activity is unwarranted. If Student
Council feels the need to strike a deal with the
Phoenix, I would propose as a possible solution a journalism class that requires a certain
number of articles be submitted to campus
publications or teaches other aspects of publication (layout, etc). The Student Council
should recognize the impact ofcompensation
on extracurriculars and should re-think its
position; students should question what need
thePhoenix fulfills that other publications do
not; and the Phoenix should question itsfocus
and motivation.

gate some kind of student uprising by plaster-

Finally, who said that students should
have the last word about hiring faculty? According to The Phoenix last week, six students were on the hiring committee. That's
more student representation than I've ever
heard of on any other hiring committee.
Moreover, Craig Williamson was quoted
last week as saying that the only members of
the hiring committee who supported Alex
unanimously were the students. In other
words some faculty, based upon the credentials of other candidates and their opinions of
Alex, doubtedthat she was the best candidate.

In order for this doubt to overcome the considerable student opinion, it had to be pretty
strong. And strong doubt usually has a reason
for being.
Why do students like Alex so much? Ido
not know. Maybe she has a nice personality.
I'm sure she's smart, and she probably has the
Correct Opinions on the basic issues around
here. But as far as teaching goes, students can
only judge one side of the story. The claim
that it was unjust for Alex to be put out ofa job
just because students like her is no claim at all.

Some PhoenixFolks Respond
To the Editor:

We are writing this letter inresponse to the
comments written by David Sturtevant '96. We
are somewhattiredofrefuting the same arguments
over and over, and hope that this will be the last
time. Let's look at what you wrote, Mr.
Sturtevant....
"I...did not miss The Phoenix" Bully for
you. We're also glad that you appreciated the
"alternative" publications. However, you say:
'Taking the initiativeand seeking schoolfunding,
they produced...on their own time
and...commitment" What? The Phoenix staff
works on somebody else's timeand commitment?
We don'treally believe thatthismakes sense. And
who do you think funds The Phoenix? The College, advertisers, and subscribers. We brought in
roughly $7,000 dollars last semester. We challenge you tofindanothergroupon campus thafhas
donethe same. As for your claimthat "Spike and
others will pick up the slack...." There is no other
publication on campus with thebreadthof coverage ofThePhoenix. There isalso no other student
publication on campus that comes out every week.
"If time is the issue (and money does not
reduce that)...."Perhapsyou haven'tbeenpaying
attention to the arguments presented in public
places on campus (Student Council meetings, the
NewsWatcher boards, and around campus in general). Time is the problem. Paying the editors will
free them from having to have a work-study
campus job. Almost all of the staff last semester
hadoutside jobs. It is difficult enough to work on
the paper and keep your academics up; having to
hold down a job makes it even more difficult.
As for athletics. Note that participants in
athletics get physical education credit. This (surprise!) frees them of the burdenofhaving to spend
time in the PE classes in which the rest of the
campus enroll. On a side note, we would like to
point out that music, theater, and dance classes get
departmental credit.
However, your final point is interesting.
You're suggesting that.. .let's see.. .a journalism
class be introduced with writing articles or participating in apublication as arequirement. Ifyou had
actually done some research before writing your
letter, you would find that the Student Council and
The Phoenix are working together to set up just
such a plan Thanks for your support, Dave; we'll
call you when it comes time to convince the
Registrar.

Now, we wonder exactly what itis you were
implying about our motives. Wedon'tknow what
you think our motives were, but we'dbehappy to
talk with you about them. However, in case you
don't ask, we'lltellyou here. ThePhoenix was not
working and something had to be done. The staff
as a whole (read: there was an election) decided
that to strike was the best option. Jonathan Seitz
and AndyPerrinwere the twopeopleelected by the
staffto carry outthe strike. No one on the Phoenix
staff acted alone in this matter. We take it as a
personal affront thatyou would question our motives without even looking into the matter. We
don't remember seeing your input at the public
discussions.Where wereyou?Why didyouchoose
to wait until after-the-fact to publish a letter in the
publication which you seem to despise?
People at Swat love tocomplain-us included.
However, many people at this place have no
interest in changing the things they complain
about You seem to be one. You chose not to give
input You chose not to try to change the outcome
ofthis affair. So don't come in now and talk about
our motives and how you don't care about The

There are three important questions which
need to be answered to understandboth the successes andfailuresofthe 1980's andtherole which
Reaganplayed in them.First, what was Reagan's
economic ideology? In other words, what was
"Reaganomics'7 Secondly, what were the major
economic trends of the 80's? Finally, how did
Reagan's policies effect these trends? With the
answers to these questions, you can judge the
Reagan record for yourself.
First of all, what is Reaganomics? Most
importantly,Reagan had extreme faith in unregulatedmarkets. Governmentwas, inother words, is
part of the problem, not the solution. Reagan also
believed that lower tax rates across the board
would cause a surge of savings, work effort and
entrepreneurial enterprises. The result would be

This ideology is called
"supply-side economics"

Reaganomics did not intentionally try tohurtthepoor at theexpenseof the
rich: thePresident (ormorecorrectly,his advisors)
calculatedthattheeconomic growthstimulatedby
his policies would eventually benefit everyone
along the income distribution. They were wrong.
The major economic trends of the 1980's
were rising income inequality, anemic long-term
economic growth and substantial increases in the
deficit The blamefor each of theseproblemsdoes
not fall solely on Reagan, as I will discuss later. It

does this mean? The vast majority of Americans,
except the top ten percent (and especially the top
1%), had very slow annual real growth rates in
income. The rich got richer and the rest stayed
about the same. Who or what is to blame for this
increased inequality? Muchofit can be accounted
forby increasing demandfor highly skilledworkers, the declining power of unions, and changes in

SLOWECONOMICGROWTH:Thequarcentury after 1948 was a golden age of economic growth in the US., with output per-capita

growth rates have slowed to a turtle-paced 1.2%.

that the slow productivity improvement since the
early 1970'shasbeen the most important cause of
our slow economic growth. This productivity
improvement comes in large part from better
worker skills (from increased educationand training) and new technology. In 1980,Reagan promised the country a miracle cure for it's anemic

was fastereconomic growth. But this growth was
stimulated by higher consumption, not by the
predicted explosion of savings, work effort and
entrepreneurial enterprises. Americans may have
bought more cars and T.V.'s, in other words, but
did not invest more in productivity-improving
factors such as education or technology. Once the
tax-savings was used up, so were faster growth
rates. All economic studies corroborate this: the
economy's longrungrowthratehas increasedlittle
if any since 1981. Slow economic growth began
before Reaganomics and continued after it.

shuttle taking off. It is true that our economy got
bigger as the deficits got bigger, but this is an

Reagan's budget directorDavid Stockman had to
become, in his own words, "a veritable incubator
of short-cuts, schemes, and devices to overcome
the truth" as heprepared thefederal budget—they
were attempting the impossible. The 1984budget
deficit, by theway, was $ 185billion —more than
double Carter's worst Did high military spending

and slow economic growth?Definitely.
The "Reagan experiment" may have had
good intentions, but showed lacklusterresults: the
economic pie failed to grow bigger, and theslices
became more unequal. The challenge of the '9os
will be to reverse these trends by creating growth
with equity. Setting theReagan record straight is
a first step towards this goal. Now, at least, we

The End of Crossword Puzzle
the Beginning ACROSS
By Ethan Borg
The end.
That is my beginning, except of course
that I am beginning with my end. Perhaps you
might accuse me of nihilism, but there would
be nothing to that argument. Or perhaps you
find it Marxist in that you find the words
revolting. But I haven't even begun—and I
never will, since I have took a left at the
Mississippi and went on straight to theend—thus, lam enGulfed by this argument: thereis
no need to begin.
Why have it? It is a nuisance; it requires
forethought. But even with the word forethought, we see the essence of my argument—in forethought, we lack "before", or
simply "be"which is thefirst and most crucial
syllable in the word "begin" (clinical studies
by Moels have proved this to be the case).
And since our ancestors created the word,
they obviously agree: there is no need for
begin.
The end.

Ask any average man
wearing a frock
whether a middle
mattered to him.
That is my middle. Sha! A middle is
useless art, a cold fission of words—a choo
choo that could, but only after its parts were
melted down to create Volvos. Let me not
lose you mid-stride, but rather catch you here
mid-sentence, with a flashing discovery, a
revelation akin to the discovery of hair balls
(mind you, someone back in the non-beginning of time was the first to notice them
popping out of his or her cat's esophagus).
The discovery is this: people throughout time
hated the middle, and henceforth called it
"mid." I submit this to you as evidence that
there is no need for the middle.
Ask any average man wearing a frock
whether a middle mattered to him. Ask Garth
Fagen, for whatever it is worth. And who
cares what they say, because frankly, I am
using them, as any middle would, to extend
this piece to the finality, theultimate ultimate,
the final period that ends the game. Yes, We
who use middles, use middles to muddlethe
matter that might mean much of nothing of
material value. It stretches, elongates, goes
on for bloody forever and ever and ever. We
who use middles are con-artists, for what we
mean to say can be said just as quickly as in
begin as in end. Which is exactly my point:
there is no need for begin—for it is enough to
have end.
And were we not to haveany end at all—it would mean nothing, or very little of something. Every day I see such things and never
notice them. And not simply because I wear a
frock.
Finally, or I should say, to start with, or
in addition to, or to whom it may concern,
please continuereading to the end (you'll find
it at the beginning). Please, if this is too
enlightening, remember to drink some liquids—or put hair balls in some liquids—or
look for split ends—or pick your teeth—revive your enlightened mind to the tangible
world, the world that is filled with germs that
cause gingivitis, and where when (you have
to trust me with this sentence) it itches, one
scratches. Do not stay in this etherial, yet
frocky (you have to trust me withthis verb) air
of 100 percent pure cotton, the world where
Elvis' pelvis still reigns.
Middle is too long. Middle conveys a
sense of having too much for too much time.
The wisdom of our ancestors stands: "mid"
will suffice.
The end.
Really, it is. It is the caboose. It is the
denoucement. It is done. Finished. Complete.
Finis. Au revoir. It is get lost. It is beware of
dog. It is three heaves and a hair ball to boot.
The end has all the meaning, and it means
this: I have nothing to say, and to say any
more wouldmake me looklike the idiot I am,
and the idiot I was from the beginning which
I could keep you from noticing until this
point, when I've run out of things to say. And
there it's said. And so I have nothing to hide.
What a relief. What a load off my shoulders.
I'm a new man, I tell you! I feel fresh, unsoiled. I am the Volvo that could.
Indeed, for me, this is a new beginning.

most values about working with students. For him, teaching is a reciprocal relationship. The best teachers, he says, are those who learn to
listen to students, both in and out of
class. The role of the teacher is to
guide students into a dialogue,
through which they discover new
ideas on their own. "I try to structure my classes so that I am surprised by my students. What's really important is to provide students
with the right questions —difficult,
unanswerable questions—that make
everybody talk. In some ways, that's
as important as knowing the material itself." He likens his teaching
philosophy to that of Chaucer's

"Mad Dog" Track Buzzards: "Good and Cocky"
"Like Mad Dogs, Small Children, and Spoons..."
by Matt Peck
The outdoor Track team has
returned, in the form of prolonged
meandering, to enlighten and hopefully entertain those of you who
follow Swarthmore's fabled 'Warriors of the Skallerup.' (May excaptainWill Roth '93, and hisnicknames, live forever.)
With high spirits and great anticipation we traveled down south
to Tallahassee for the break. Our
meet, with some obscure teams like
Slippery Rock, PA, Eastern Shore,
MD, Wabash, IN, and Albion, MI,
was laidback andfun. Sam Paschel
'96 was the stud of the meet as he
endured the near 90 degree heat
(quite a shock to his icy PA system
I'm sure) to compete in the prestigious decathlon. That's right, in
two days Sam jumped (twice
long and high), vaulted, hurdled,
heaved (the shot), sprinted (twice
the 100 and 400m), picked up
heptathaletes, tossed(jav and disc)
and ran a mile. (Hum, eleven
events...oh well, he can handle it).
Beyond the meet, we trained
hard,played stick ball, threwfrisbee,
listened to exactly lOsongsonMTV
and relaxed in other ways I really
can't tell you about. The annual
euchre tournament wouldhavebeen
a success, but it was derailedby one
of our freshman's skewed priorities. Who needs love anyway? Regardless, we had a blast and the trip
boosted both team moral and unity.
Now that we are back north,
we have tried to avoid the cold and
rain by competing in Virginia for
the past two weekends. Two weeks
ago we were at Washington and
Lee. According to most, Scott
Reents '96 turned in the performance of the day by running a sub

side, Walid "Mad Dog" Khalid '97

who gave Walid his nickname,
shouldhave tried the elixirhimself
as he missed the bus at the hotel.
The following weekendat the
Battleground Relays Mr. Packurar
made up for his previous blunder
by charging over 400 meters worth
of steel (okay, aluminum) barriers
to win the 400 hurdles in a blazing

and all-around stud Al Molnar '97

Swat Weight Room Undergoes Spring Break Face Lift
by Mike Higgins
Swarthmoreis not well known
for its commitment to athletic endeavors. Reflecting this lack of concern, the weight room, untilrecently,
was poorlyequipped tomeettheneeds
of any student who sought greater
physical fitness. Over Spring Break,
this situation changed dramatically.
Completed soon after classes resumed, the 'new' fitness center, located in room 19 of the Tarble Athletic Center, far exceeds the capabilities of its predecessor by complementing the existing rooms and providing studentswithgreater resources,
up to date equipment and a variety of
exercise options.
The old weight room, defined
by an uncoordinated assortment of
free weight equipment and nautilus
machines, was not wellsuited to students following integrated fitness
programs. To achieve abalanced regimen, students were often forced to
create their own exercises. Chris
Fowler '97 notes, "I lost a lot of time
just trying to imagine ways to work
differentmuscle groups with the limited range of existing equipment."
Some of the equipment in the
old weight room was in disrepair
while other pieces were simply incompatible with one another. Combining differing equipment contributed to the room's general ineffimaking lifting

campus. Offering a variety of different exercises, both simple and complex at virtually any weight, the fitnesscenter provides excellent opportunities for any student interested in
greater levels of fitness or simply an
opportunity to add another dimension to their workouts. Students having little or no experience in weight
training, whose options were in many
ways limited by the resources of the
older weightroom, have vastly greater
opportunities to develop sophisticated
lifting programs using the new facilities at the fieldhouse.

Baseball Brings Out the Big Bats
Inside Look at the Garnet Tide's Line-up
By Charles Hudson
After losing 12 players to graduation
from a squad that finished in second place in
the MAC southeast last season, 1994 Garnet
Tide baseball knew it had some big shoes to
fill. Coach Ernie Prudente attempted to make
the transition as smooth as possible by bringing in a large groupoffreshman faces eager to
see varsity action. However, injuries and a
trip to the highly competitive Cocoa Expo in
Cocoa Beach, FL, has causedinevitable grow
ing pains to occur.
The team returned to the Arctic north
with a 1-7 record, leaving this young squad
with a combined 2-11 record entering conference play this Saturday.
Here's a look at how the Tide shapes up
for '94.
.
PITCHING
The loss of many seniors has left the
GarnetTide pitching staff searching for help.
The Tide had hoped to find that help in the
strong young arms ofTobinLanzetta '97 and
Patrick Straub '97. Unfortunately, injuries
have hampered* both in the early going.
Lanzetta has just returned from a three-week
layoff due to an elbow sprain in his pitching
arm and Straub will miss theremainder ofhis
freshman season with a severe ankle sprain.
However, even with injuries to two ofits
top pitchers, the Garnet Tide pitching staff
has done a consistent job ofkeeping the team
in aposition to win ball games.ChuckHudson
'96, 3-1 3.62 ERA last season, ranks 7th
among returning pitchers in the Centennial
Conference in Earned Run Average. The big
right -hander should see many innings as one
of the Tide's top starting pitchers. Lefty Kirk
Daulerio '95 notched one of the Garnet's two
winsof the year over Philadelphia Pharmacy,
but will primarily see action as a top reliever
on the team. GeneLam' 94 hopes to finish his
Swat career with a solid season, and so far
leads the Garnet Tide with 9 appearances in
the first 13 games. He will be used as a
workhorse out of the bullpen, a role which
saw him yield (J runs in 9 innings oi work last
year. Dan Malkoun '97, Dave Lischer '97,
Jeremy Bonder '97, Sam Voolich '96 and
JeffGans '95 will also see time on the hill this
year.
INFIELD
First Base— Co-captain Todd Kim'94
and Andrew Clayton '96 will battle for playing time at the first sack this year. Kim hit .500

triple against Phila. Pharmacy. Clayton, although a sophomore, is in his first season with
the club. Shoulder surgery caused him to miss
the entire '93 campaign, but as his 2 hits this
past Saturday would indicate, the Big Cat"
is showing no ill effects and is ready to play.
Second Base—Two freshman look to
split time here. Jeremy Bonder and J.P.Simon
form the secondbase duo. Simon was impressive in an extended look in the games in
Florida, but Bonder's return from his bout
withmononucleosisprovides Coach Prudente
with a difficult choice.
Shortstop—Matt Grossman '96 has the
unenviable task ofreplacing a two-time AllMAC selection at shortstop. Grossman play
is improving with each game and he hit .385
(6-16) this past week.
Third Base—Matt Wiggins '96 hit .333
last year (6th among returning CC batters)
after cracking the lineup at the end of last
season. This year he has a position all to
himself and has picked up right where he left
off.
Catcher—Co-captain Bob Mascia '95
returns to a familiar spot after spending most
of last season in the outfield and as a designatedhitter. His powerful bat will be a driving
force of the Garnet lineup.
OUTFIELD
Center fielderFrank Santora '96 hit .409
in conference play last season and has welcomed the switch from right to center with
open arms. Hitting .303 to date, Frank is
leading the team into this weekend.
Left Field has been patrolled mainly by
MattHultman '94. However, strong competition has been provided by Brian Leutke '96
and Craig Rodner '96, both hitting .500 in
limited playing time and commanding more
action.
Right field will be occupied by Darius
Tandon'94. The left-hander had a homer,
triple and 3 RBI in a double header explosion
at Cocoa. The Tide hopes to see thatrepeated

a terror on the base paths and will be used
accordingly. Dan Malkoun '97 and Chris

this year.
The Garnet Tide will begin conference

on Tuesday, April 5, vs Ursinus at 3:00 p.m.

may only be 1-8 but the future looks brighter
than one might expect. Made primarily of
sophomores and freshman, the extremely
young team has a wealth of talent, yet a lack
of experience. First year head coach Zach
Colburn realized the only way to mold a
strong team would be to challenge the young
players. And challenge them he does by including in the schedule some of the toughest
teams. Right off the bat, S wat confronted two
first class teams during a Spring Break trip to
Virginia. By forcing Swat to play against such
tough schools, Colburn hopes that the players
will eventually rise to the occasion and become a force to be reckoned with.
The lacrosse team's captains are Dave
JarrosandCary Schaub. Scoring leaders have
been Brian Dougherty, Ben "Bugs" Seigel,

and Andy Place. Star defense men, Shannon
Brown and Charles Horton, are doing a fine
jobprotecting goalie Tim Gasperoni. Yet the
weak-link seems to be the attack, where not
being able to score has been a cross to bear.
Nevertheless, players are optimistic. Upon
thereturn ofcaptain (and perennial top scorer)
Schaub, currently recovering from a broken
foot, a much needed spark will be given to the
offense.
Talent abounds on the team including
some freshmen stars. Pat Donaghy, who previously had never played the sport, surprised
all by displaying some impressive stick-handling on the field. And freshman goalie Ben
Henwood will soon burst out from under
Gasperoni's shadow to reveal a very bright
star protecting the goal. All in all, despite a
weak beginning season, Swat's lacrosse team
has the talent and determination to soon become a winning institution.

Shepardson Soars and Cunningham Cruises the Track
Ah, spring! That exuberant season of
budding love, balmy days, and outdoor track.
My heart just leaps at the thought ofit all: The
talented women's track and field team manages to combine all three of these lovely
spring thoughts into its daily workout (weather
permitting). This year the team will not let its
small numbers disguise the truth: we are lean,
mean, and ready to crush all obstacles in our
path to fame and glory! Beating Haverford,
that is.
On March 25 and 26, the Swat team

workout agony, Klosterman, ran the 1500
run. Running the 400 hurdles for the first time
in years, Cunningham placed a very strong
fourth. The 4x400m relay composed of
Cunningham, Dempsey, Wildonger and
Shepardson placed a gutsy fourth, with a time
not quite that far off the school record (a lone
one second).
Now, if any of you Swatties want to
support this kickin' team, move your rears on
down to the track THIS FRIDAY. Starting at
3 pm, we'll be competing against Haverford
and Widener, and we would love your support. Hey, the walk to the track is shorter than
the distance we run in our warm-up.
