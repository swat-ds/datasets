New Information Surfaces on Homophobic Hate Speech
Shaving cream incident in Mertz bathroom
raises questions about hate speech policy

Student-Run Course Offers Fresh
Perspectives on Race and Diversity

by Corey Datz-Greenberg
and Sarah Kowalski
Shortly before winter break, an
individual student was targeted in
a hate speech incident in which the
student's name and the words "fuck
fag" were sprayed with shaving
cream on a Mertz bathroom wall.
The incident concluded a semester
that saw numerous homophobic
chalkings and other unpublicized
episodes of anti-queer sentiment.
The bathroom incident was reported to Public Safety officials
who took photographs of the scene
and interviewed the student's
hallmates. Two RAs and the targeted student met the next day with
Associate Dean Tedd Goundie.The
student expressed a desire that no
administrative bulletin be sent to
the campus condemning anti-queer
hate speech because he felt that
such an email alone would not
make any difference. He did, however, hope that the administration
would somehow publicize the
event in order to help prompt more
community action against hate
speech incidents of this sort. However, aside from a brief article in
The Daily Gazette, the incident was
not reported in any way before the
College closed for winter break.
The Public Safety investigation
into the matter has so far been inconclusive, and the perpetrators
have not been identified. However,
according to Public Safety Director Owen Redgrave, they were
probably Swarthmore students.
Public Safety, together with the
deans, decided against sending out
a bulletin notifying the community
about the incident, primarily because public safety bulletins are
intended to warn the community
about a threatening person. The
consensus was that thisincident did
not warrant thatkind of a message.
Shortly thereafter, students from
the newly-formed Queer Straight
Alliance (QSA) and other members
of the queer and queer-friendly
community expressed their concerns to the administration about
queer safety on campus, and the
need for more institutional mechanisms to ensure this safety.
Specifically, they were concerned
with the lack of publicity and the
lack of automatic and effective institutional responses to provide
support for the targeted individual.
"I think the deans didn't know
what to do and their response was
to ask the students what to do. I find
that frustrating because they were
not taking a position of leadership
in this instance," said the targeted
individual.
This is part of a larger problem,
says a concerned student. "I understand the administration is inexperienced, but I feel relatively unsupported."

The perceived lack of support
may be a function of the
community's inexperience with this
issue, according to Amy Albert '9B,
one of the students currently involved in addressing this issue with
the administration.
"I realize that because queer issues are changing, they're in progression... the deans don't necessarily understand these issues. They
may care, but they don'tknow how
to address it," says Albert. Therefore, she says, "we need a broad
institutional evaluation of treatment
of queer students, a reassessment
of goals, of where we are and where
we want to be."
Along these lines, concerned students met with the deans shortly
before winter break to discuss the
issue. One of the ideas suggested
at this meeting was the formation
of a response team to support and
advocate for queer students who are
targets of harassment.
The student targeted in the Mertz
incident claims that such a team
would be helpful. "I was lucky, I
had people who could be advocates
for me. Not everyone in my position would have those contacts. In
that case, they would have to advocate for themselves which is very
difficult if you're a victim of a hate
speech," he said.
Other ideas included ensuring the
publicity of any future hate speech
episodes. Publicity could come in
the form of public safety bulletins,
which are designed to inform and
warn the community of a possible
threat, in the form of all-campus
letters
the

Publicity is especially important,
according to Associate Professor of
History Pieter Judson, who chairs

faculty, staff, and students that
speaks to queer issues in the Swarthmore community. "I think publicity is crucial," he says. "These in-

Sexgate vs. Watergate
Prof. Raymond Hopkins of the Political Science Department examines
the personalities of Clinton and Nixon as he attempts to draw parallels
between the current scandal and Watergate. The power of the press to
facilitate the creation of a "condensation symbol" that put Nixon in an
almost inextricable situation will also come into play in the recent
downturn of the Clinton administration, he says.

Since their meeting with students,
the deans have outlined four major
areas of concern, says Acting Dean
Bob Gross. The first of these involves community response and
publicity.
The second area of concern involves readdressing the hate speech
policy. As it stands, the policy states
that a hateful comment must be directed at an individual and that the
perpetrator must then have the opportunity to be educated on his/her
actions. If after this educational
session the perpetrator repeats the
hateful sentiments, then legal proceedings can ensue.
Talia Young 'Ol, co-founder of
QSA, realizes that a re-examination
of the hate speech policy is not just
a queer issue. "To consider a

Young 'Ol, and myself— stood surrounded
by acres of sludge from the southwest area
of GreaterPhiladelphia. It smelled bad. Here
is the story of why we were there.
Earthlust, the Swarthmore campus environmental organization, had organized a visit to
the Southwest Water Control Plant and the
Biosolids Recycling Center. The group
wanted to investigate the facilities from an
environmental perspective, and had arranged
to be given guided tours around each plant.
The reason for Earthlust's interest in sewage, however, lay back on the verdant lawns
of our esteemed college. During the previous semester, several members of the group
had met with Stuart Hain and Jeff Jabco of
theFacilities Management Department to discuss the possibility of a campus composting
program. The primary objective of the program would have been to convert food waste
from Sharpies cafeteria into reusable mulch.
The College formerly had operated a studentrun compost program, but problems developed in its operation and the program was
discontinued.
Hain and Jabco pointed out that, indirectly,
Swarthmore does compost much of its food
waste. Waste that is put into the garbage disposals in the cafeteria kitchen enters the sewage system. The College's sewage then goes
to the Southwest Water Control Plant, and
from there to the Biosolids Recycling Center, which processes the sewage into a viable
compost product. The Swarthmore Arboretum then buys this product and uses it as fertilizer on the College's lawns. Thus, our grass

initially may
have been disconcerting, it seemed like an appealingly cyclic process. It appeared that Swarthmore was engaged in a sort of composting
symbiosis with the Philadelphia Water Department.

Before Earthlust was ready to endorse this system as a composting technique, however, the
group wanted to visit the plants in question to
find out just how environmentally sound the process actually was. The tours were arranged.
The Southwest Water Control Plant is where
Swarthmore's sewage goes first, along with the
sewage from half of Philadelphia and parts of
Delaware County. Therefore, it was also where
we went first. And the first thing we wanted to
know was, "How do you regulate what comes
into the plant?" The plant can't regulate, explained our guide, a no-nonsense woman named

Deborah. If a company suddenly dumps a lot of
toxic waste into the sewers, it can have devastating effects on the plant and on the river, because
the plant will have to discharge the material without treating it. For this reason, the Pennsylvania
Department of Environmental Protection and the
EPA have become increasingly strict about making industries regulate their own waste.
As it turns out, sludge has different parts, and
in the plant they go different ways. First, screens
pull large trash items out of the inflowing sewage. Then sludge is subsequently left to settle in
endless rows of open-air tanks. Here, most solids
settle to the bottom, while an oily scum rises to
the top. The scum is skimmed off and taken to a
landfill, and the settled solids are pumped to the
solids processing area. Through the 19705,

Reconciling Theory and Practice
A recent spate of hate speech incidents targeted at the queer community
on campus has raised questions about the effectiveness of the current speech
code.

resort. First, the incident must be deemed adjudicable by the Equal Opportunity Officer, and then the faculty panel of the College Judicial Committee
(CJC) must also establish that going forward with the procedures will not
violate individual rights to free expression or the Colleges commitment to
freedom. So even a rare case of traceable hate speech would have to overcome all these bureaucratic barriers before any form ofredress can be sought
let alone a case where the perpetrator is unknown.
What we see here is a supposed attempt to strike a balance between preserving free speech and protecting victims of hate speech. Yet in this case
the balance is not quite a balance
it seems that there is a premium laid on
free speech.
Following the latest incidents, the Deans immediately issued strong letters of condemnation, but no concrete action was taken. Right now the Colthe guidelines encourlege has placed the emphasis on groupresolution
ageboth sides (if both sides can be found) involved in any case to engage in
a mediation process. Victims may pursue the option of seeking legal redress on their own, but can most of them afford to do so, either financially
or otherwise?
The framers of the guidelines make a point to distinguish between
Swarthmore and society-at-large. Granted, Swarthmore is not a civil society with the responsibilities or resources of a civil society. Yet the fact is
that the majority of hate speech incidents in past years have been anonymous
and there do not exist a formal set of procedures or guidelines to
deal with them.The current guidelines may be right in principle and theory
this is still up for debate but they are far removed from reality. Again,
naturally it would be hard to act if you can't identify the culprit, but right
now there simply isn't any form of institutional acknowledgment of existence of anonymous hate speech and its consequences. What's the point of
having laws that will never be applied? The College has announced that it
will reconsider the present guidelines in light of the latest developments.
And we hope that in doing so, it not only reconciles the interests of free
speech and those of the victims but more importantly, the conflicting tendencies of principle and practicality.

The Heart of the Scandal
The most recent allegations of marital infidelity against President Clinton
have inspired discussion and scandal-mongering worldwide. The most recent allegations concerning Monica Lewinsky have done everything from
casting further doubt on Clinton's honesty in previous situations of the kind
to leading Saddam Hussein to assert that the United States would attack
Iraq to deflect the allegations in a scenario reminiscent of "Wag the Dog."
The topic that has not received its deserved share of time within this debate
is the exact nature and relevance of Clinton's "unpresidential" conduct. Is
it his alleged marital infidelity? Perhaps, by current standards, however
this was no impediment to public respect for Presidents such as Eisenhower
and Kennedy.
More likely, as with Richard M. Nixon, with whom he is constantly compared, it is the nature of the cover-up operation. Yet even this does not fully
capture the problematic nature of his alleged misdeeds, after all, Washington, DC would not have developed as the world's spin capital if there were
nothing on which to put a spin. More disturbing is the implication that in
addition to ordering Lewinsky to perjure herself, President Clinton has engaged in perjury himself, not only in this case, but in general. It is the
inconsistencies of his stories in previous sexual harassment cases coupled
with his conduct in this affair that call into question his respect, as the President of the United States, for the American government and legal system.
It is this possibility that should be of the most concern. After all, newspapers around the world (most notably in France, whose late PresidentFrancois
Mitterand was given his last rites in the presence of his wife, his mistress,
and his progeny by both women), have found the idea of a sex scandal less
than scandalous. While no one would argue that adultery (defined in the
conventional rather than the Clintonian sense) is defensible, it is not the
primary reason that Clinton, should the allegations be proven true, would
do well to resign. Such an affair would be damaging, though largely irrelevant to a presidency in which the economy has grown at levels not seen for
several decades. Rather, it is President Clinton's disregard for the foundations of the American or indeed any free legal system, that would merit his
resignation. As the events of the Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Nixon administrations have shown, the moral actions of president in a courtroom rather
than a bedroom are most important in terms of respect for the American
government.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
Integrity and Autonomy of PGA Should be Preserved
To the Editor:
Ben Chan (Op-ed, Jan. 23) argues that the
PGA tour should make an exception to
accomodate the needs of Casey Martin, a
rookie plagued by Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber
syndrome, a degenerative disorder that now
makes it nearly impossible for him to walk
great distances. In the past, Martin was able
to compete by walking the course or was allowed the use of a cart to aid him in his playing. The PGA currently bans the use of carts
by players at all tournaments.
After a stellar collegiate career at Stanford,
Martin tried to join the PGA Tour. He, in a
grueling six-day event, managed to qualify for
play on the Tour. By this point, however,
Martin's legs had deteriorated to such a point
that he was not able to walk the four to five
miles required in a round of golf. Thus, under normal circumstances, he would not be
able to play on the PGA Tour, which requires
that all golfers walk the four rounds of competitive play. Martin then asked for and was
denied permission to use a golf cart. His suit
is now pending in a Federal court.
What is here at issue is not whether Martin
should be allowed to play, because he is, provided he adhere to the rules set forth by the
PGA. Rather, what we must understand is
that, perhaps in a way too subtle to be understood by those not familiar with the game,allowing Martin to use a cart would undermine
not only the equal and competitive nature of
the game of golf, but it would be an affront to
the independence of associational bodies
across the United States.
Most of us do not have a favorite golf moment. Many of us have not even played a round
of golf, save at the local put-put. It is at best a
quiet and unobtrusive way our fathers and
uncles spend their Saturday afternooons; at
worst, it contributes to the noticeable lack of
quality television at 4 p.m. on Sunday. Yet for
Martin and the professionals of the PGA Tour,
golf is an obsession, and moreover, a way of
life. For them, the game of golf is more than
the hitting of a silly white ball. It is a game of
both physical and mental endurance. The skill

Sexgate: Parallels
With The Past
•

by Raymond R Hopkins

As BILLWATCH threatens to replace
BAYWATCH in TV ratings, observers
of politics have a chance to watch some
striking parallels unfold. Presidential
scandals, at least in recent years, have
ariews driven logic that is almost rulelike. The Nixon and Clinton
have much in common in this regard.'.
Qf course, to visualize their common
patterns you must rise above pandering puffery practiced by prognosticating pundits [Bill Safire?].

Key Parallels
-What do the scandals have in common? First, both require a simplified
interpretation: one that calls for a yes
or no, guilty or innocent judgment.
Second, both have a common origin.
Their source is
Presidential lust
for an addictive
indulgence.
These commonalities combine
with mass media
dynamics, exposing private
character flaws,
one frequent
among risk-taking personalities.
In the Watergate scandal there was
an implicit search during six months
of initial news coverage for a condensation symbol, a term that could capture the rich complexity of events encompassed by "the scandal." The term
that was finally chosen, "Watergate,"
put a frame around events that, under
most circumstances, would have no
connection with each other. Once this
occurred many connections and
reconnections flowed among the press
and Congress with an astonishing
speed. Nixon's case shows how simplification to one word allows editorial writers, politicians, and the lay
public to label to see more clearly what
they sense is as a related set of scandal
incidents. This labeling enables people
to pour complex events and interpretations, often competing with one another, into a common reference to the
situation.
• "Watergate" [a place name] allowed

Nixon's administration's dirty tricks,
illegal fund raising, burglaries, lying,
and its attempts of to cover up these
actions to be condensed into one word.
It was a powerful simplification that
helped build the coalition that drove
Nixon from office. His use of the CIA,
FBI, and White House staff, along with
the invocation of powerful claims such
as executive privilege and national security proved of no avail to Nixon in
containing his scandal.
The Clinton administration now faces
an even more diffuse set of allegations.
Beginning with "Whitewater" [a sleazy
real estate deal, involving James
McDougal's ties to Bill and Hillary]
and for which an independent counsel
Ken Starr
was appointed to investigate the matter discussions of a
Clinton presidency scandal has broadened. The expanded scandal includes the Jennifer

the
cover-up,

Vincent
Foster's suicide,
investigations into
"travel-gate" and
"file-gate" [now
closed after Congressional hearings
cleared 29 Clinton administration officials],
issues of illegal campaign
fund raising in 1996, and, most recently, the MonicaLewinsky affair and
cover-up.
With the Clinton administration we
have a far broader disarray of allegations than in Nixon's scandal. Whatever the totality ofClinton's violations
ofAmerican moral and legal standards,
however, we lack a symbol to capture
the Presidency's diffuse and messy activities. Whitewater is old news
probably not actionable nor impeachable. So where is the new term to
package all the scandalous action?
He [and we] would do well to study
the lessons of Watergate. Regarding
the first point in common between the
two scandals, a search for a condensation symbol [i.e. a term to capture the
rich complexity of "scandal" events],
a simplified term is still needed for the
Clinton scandal. Without it editorial

writers, politicians, and the lay public
have no one image into which to pour
the complex array of events and interpretations of Clinton's actions. It took
six months for "Watergate" to emerge
as a term that did this. This empty term
allowed Nixon's administration's dirty
tricks, illegal fund raising, burglaries,
lying, and its attempts of to cover-up
these actions to be condensed into one
word. It was a powerful simplification

A Heartbreaking Downfall

America has fallen into dark times. Last week,
President Bill Clinton was holding a joint press conference alongside Yassir Arafat. Reporters asked the
two leaders questions about war, about peace, about
the lives of thousands and thousands of human beings. Suddenly, among the noise of world politics, a
voice was heard, a loud, clarion voice, asking the
President how he responded to allegations of infidelity and perjury. It is because of that voice that I
say that America has fallen into dark times. It is because America is facing a crisis. It is not a crisis of
arms, or of tyranny, or of defeat, but a crisis of morality, a crisis that makes it possible for the President of the United States to be sitting next a world
leader with the balance of war and peace held waveringly in his hand, and be asked in full candor
whether or not he slept with a girl less than half his
age.
How ludicrous! What has happened withAmerica's
president? What are we, as Americans, to feel about
this? What are we to do? "It is inevitable," think
some people. "I never liked him anyway." I myself
feel very betrayed and very disappointed in Clinton,
arid I feel so mainly because I think that such a scandal was not inevitable, and that Clinton was not worthy of our dislike and mistrust from the beginning.
Why do I say that? Stricken by these new accusations, which I believe to be true, I found myself skimming through Clinton's biography. It affirmed my
belief that, regardless of whatever scandals and politics Clinton has lived through, he actually cares, or
at least cared, for the people of America, and once
had a strong sense of morality. This care and this
morality is no more blatantly expressed in the benediction that he was asked to give at his high school
graduation in 1964:
...We must prepare to live only by the guide
of our own faith and character. We pray to
keep a high sense of values while wandering
through the complex maze which is our society. Direct us to know and care what is right
and wrong, so that we will be victorious in
this life and rewarded in the next. Lord give

us the strength to do these things. Leave
within us the youthful idealism and moralism
which have made our people strong. Sicken
us at the sight of apathy, ignorance and rejection so that [we] will remove complacency,
poverty and prejudice from the hearts of free
men.

It is this "youthful idealism" thatcaused me to support Clinton, even as a young child, barely an adolescent. I supported him when he tried to reform
health care with the aid ofhis wife, when he stood up
against the Contract with America, and when Republicans tried to wreck his life with theWhitewater hearings; I even supported him, God help me, when Congress rammed enough politics, scandals, and lobbying down his throat that he folded and irreversibly
cut welfare, because I did not see him swerve far
enough from what I knew him to believe to lose all
faith in him.
Now, however, I find myself looking at him and
believing that he does not deserve to be our President. He has a passion that brought him many things
in life, with the Presidency as the culmination. He
has an "idealism" that brought to his people a better
economy, more jobs, and a vision of a better future.
He also has what I would call a psychological problem with women. As President, he must put aside
such problems, and uphold the standards of our society. He is the leader whom we are supposed to respect and look to as a guide. In this, he has failed.
He has failed his wife; I'm sure that she is furious.
He has betrayed his daughter, who must be horrified
to even show her face at Stanford. He has betrayed
himself and his ideals by this act. Above all, he has
betrayed his people, because he has not been honest
with us. I don't think many of you doubt his guilt;
when a leader is so blatantly dishonest with his
people, and plans to discard his morals so horribly in
the forsaking of his family and then to lie about doing so, he ceases to be a leader and starts to become
a blot. His benediction no less valid for his sins, he
has ultimately betrayed his own words, and is now
unworthy of our faith and his role of our leader.

such as executive privilege and national
security to fight Watergate, but to no
avail.
The second parallel in Clinton's scandal to the one Nixon encountered in
1972-74 is the common origin ofPresidential misbehavior. Nixon sought
power in excess. He was probably compensating for a deprived status in childhood. Caesar also was power mad;
Nero was love mad. Both had endearing flaws flowing from elevating the
need for one value indulgence much too

Over the five odd years of his presidency, President
Clinton has established a distinct (often execrated) political attitude and reputation. Until the present scandal involving Monica Lewinsky, he had been as successful in
shrugging of controversy ofhis many sexual relationships
as (if we are to believe the ever more credible rumors) the
relationships themselves. At the same time, he has taken
progressively fewer controversial positions, constantly
seeking to align himselfwith politically moderate stances
on issues that appeal to a large sector of the population.
When he chooses to enter into positions that involve disagreement or criticism, he has solidifiedhis stance by producing false dilemmas, or in other cases, choosing an example that proves his point rather than accurately depicting the general success of a program. Through it all, he
invokes a mythical American consensus, which wavers
between keen political insight, and a less forceful (and
equally inaccurate) reincarnation of Richard Nixon's silent majority.
Clinton's silence during the address on the subject of
Lewinsky, certainly one of the more noticeable elements
of the speech, was justly expected. Clinton's compartmentalization of this issue recalls his treatment of similar personal problems in the past. Equally inevitable was his focus on the state of the economy, his greatest political asset. He took special pains to enunciate the progress toward a balanced budget during his administration (just with
whom the credit lies is an open question) and in keeping
with his past attempts to inflate the positive, he speciously
claimed "we will produce balanced budgets as far as the
eye can see." In fact, some economists doubt whether the
budget will remain balanced for five years, while most
agree that it will almost certainly fall into the red once
again when the baby boom generation retires. No doubt
conscious of these notions, Clinton enunciated the only
part of the speech that might have come as a surprise, declaring all budget surpluses should be used to "save social
security first." If this means essentially devoting the surpluses to debt servicing and retire, it is an admirable goal,
at the very leastit represents that classic tenet ofClintonian
rhetoric, it's all right to make slightly heterodox promises
as long as they are ones certain to cater to a broad group,
whom he phrased in this speech to include everyone now
working or who has worked. That said, it is certainly fiscally wiser than the Conservative suggestion of devoting
the surpluses to tax cuts.
The President took relatively uncontroversial positions
in his address on a variety of other issues from human

Sophistry at its best.
cloning to tax credits to allow students to attend at the
very least junior college. When Clinton had to tackle the
issue of the high cost of a full college education and of
graduate degrees, however, he characteristically imbued
his words with Panglossian simplicity, stating that "for
junior and senior year, graduate school and job training,
there's a lifetime learning credit." His choice of "credit,"
obviously in the sense of achievement, but implied in the
sense of financial support paralleling the tax credit for
junior college, exemplified the sophistry which he used to
buttress several ofhis other, possibly controversial points.
This is similar to a general manner he has used to advance
possibly unpleasant (as in ignoring the case of the high
cost of a college education) or controversial points. He
used the same tactic in declaring that during his time in
office, five million children had gained health insurance,
while ignoring the revocation of health-care benefits for
disabled children whose families are on welfare, perhaps
the most vulnerable individuals in American society. He
spoke with similar lack of clarity in outlining programs to
help workers who lose their jobs because of such Free
Trade Proposals such as NAFTA. He phrased the victims
of this dislocation euphemistically and inaccurately as
those "temporarily left behind by the global marketplace."
Those who observed his speech closely should doubt his
commitment in this area, given that he outlined in detail
how he intends to reform the public educational system,
yet not how he plans to care for those who lose their jobs.
The globalization of the economy is a highly complex
process; solutions to its short-term costs deserve better
than such deliberately ambiguous sophistry. He also made
use of his favored tactic of choosing single exemplary
Americans to prove points, inviting a woman who had
success through a welfare to work program and a decorated American serviceman who had served in Bosnia to
"prove" that reform was working and further involvement
in Bosnia is necessary.
The most ironic aspect of the speech was the President's
continued reference to shared values. Whether it was his
introductory claim that "families are strong" or the common values of "family and faith" and "freedom and responsibility," they struck a highly ironic note. Besides the
way in which such generalizations necessarily gloss over
deep fissures in American society, their very definition is
the subject of argument, by Clinton among others. Several of the President's words struck an odd note: "Could
he really be saying this in light of what has been going
on?" But then again, through his tenure Clinton has done
nothing if not compartmentalize. His promises for 220,000
Pell Grants, $6 billion dollars of tax cuts in order to help
combat global warming, and his proposal for a twentyfirst century research fund have merit, but were lost in his
well used (and historically successful) rhetoric. In his State
of the Union Address, the President returned to his favored rhetorical arsenal: using ambiguity to deal with
possibly controversial issues, sophistry to avoid others,
and using single positive human examples to make the
case for programs which have not in fact had the glowing
success of these particular people. These rhetorical devices are as distinctive a mark ofhis presidency as its numerous sex scandals.

and Choosing Help
Sophomores Plan for
Future at Swat
By Janine Gibbons
A survey of the 403 graduating seniors of the Class of '97 revealed
that Economics majors were going
on to pursue personal happiness, Biology majors were heading off to
Taiwan to study acupuncture, and
Religion majors were running the
Grandma's Marathon in Duluth,
MN.
On Thursday, January 22, members of the Class of'OO took thefirst
step towards similar fates. Sophomores participated in Chocolates
and Choosing, an informational session on selecting a major and writing the Sophomore Paper. An
evening of desserts and discussion
allowed students the opportunity to
hear from deans and faculty regarding the implications of choosing a
major, and to voice their own questions: How does your major relate
to and influence career choices, job
opportunities, and graduate study?
What are the more popular majors,
what are companies looking for, and
where are they seeing the most job
opportunities?
At the College, students have at
their disposal the Career Planning
and Placement Office. Its main objective is to assist students with career choices through a variety of activities and programs ranging from
career counseling to job search
workshops to alumni search requests. According to Director Tom
Francis, the Career Planning Office
is there to provide information to
students, to talk through their ideas
and plans, and offer support.
While Francis can attest to the
wide variety of majors students

choose, he does admit that thereare
favorites. In recent years the most
popular majors have been, in no
particular order, Biology, Economics, Political Science, History, Engineering, and Psychology. However, the correlation between one's
major and one's careers or life
choices is not always clear. Internships, externships, volunteeropportunities, and summer experiences
often play a role in directing people
towards certain fields. It should
also be mentioned that most students can look forward to more than
one career in their lifetimes.
In disciplines such as the natural
sciences, there is often a more direct correlation between major and
career. Science majors tend to possess skills specific to a certain position, though this is not completely
prescriptive. Francis holds that in
nearly one-third of the instances
there is a direct correlation between
a student's major and his future intentions, in one-third of the cases
the correlation is less obvious, and
for the remaining third the choice
is completely random. In Francis'
experience, it has been the case that
"what you major in as an undergraduate is not going to determine
your career." Nor is there a correlation between sophomore year uncertainty and eventual success.
Employers today are mainly in
search of intelligent people who are
prepared to work and are used to
working hard. As Francis explains,
its more a question of their "attitude and training" than a particular
major. Rather than placing emphasis on the specificity of one's major, employers are more interested

Hate Speech

we need to consult all other groups on campus who
are potentially affected by hate speech." QSA is in
the process of contacting these other organizations,
she says.
A third area of concern is ensuring the safety of
students. Since the Mertz incident, many queer students have expressed a fear for their physical safety.
"I'm not as comfortable here, as a queer student, as I
was before the incident," says the targeted individual.
Gross acknowledges that the students' fears should
be taken seriously, but he warns against making too
much out of the threats. "I would point to the fact
that, in spite of 2,3,4 chalkings a year, at least in my
memory, there has been nothing physical. The perception of threat needs to be dealt with. However, we
urge people to keep it in perspective."
The fourth area concerns community education relating to the missions of the educational program, according to Gross. "I think our general approach in
areas of community building which surround issues
of gender relations or ethnic diversity has been to create a climate of tolerance," he says.
However, he feels it is important to recognize that
"even if we were 98 percent effective in our educational program, 25 students could still put the community in turmoil." He thinks it is important to remember that "we are not a differentplanet, not a perfect community, and we are not immune from outside culture and adolescent development."
Other solutions that QSA has come up with include
heightened dormitory awareness, campus-wide tolerance education, and a peer mentorship network in
which queer students offer support to students dealing with queer issues.
Ultimately, Judson maintains that "the college
should have mechanisms to deal with things like this.
It shouldn't the student's burden to develop answers."
Still, Gross believes that "student responses are a
very goodthing for community education. I think the
queer community is more visible and coherent and
has more energy which didn't exist 10 years ago, and
they're facing these issues now due to their developed
confidence and visibility."
Therefore, he says, the students must contribute to
the decision- making process. "We are most effective
when we work together with students to fix problems."

in why someone chose to major in
what she did and how she chose to
pursue it both inside and outside of
theclassroom. Employers, schools
Francis, are interested in the
"rhyme and reason" of one's
choice.
Equally important are a student's
academic record, summer experiences, internships, and volunteer
opportunities. Employers and
graduate schools will understand
the various circumstances of students' lives and are interested in
what they found out about themselves and the wider world through
their experiences. Francis insists
that opportunities such as these allow one to experience, first-hand,
the complexity and variety of careers people hold. Not only does it
make it easier to get a job, employers are aware that it will allow students to relate their education to a
field of work.
Today, one-half of all new jobs
are found in the service sector.
There is increasing demand in the
field of computer science as well

as communications. Presently, students are being recruited by highprofile management consultants,
investment bankers, and not-forprofit organizations. The up and
down cycle of business has much
to do with where jobs are to be
found. In recent years, metropolitan areas like Atlanta, Boston, Portland, and Seattle have benefited
from flourishing job markets, growing cultural opportunities, first-rate
school systems, and decreasing cost
of living.
A number of challenges await
students in the workplace. Francis
mentions three of these. First of
all, looking for a job is a time-consuming process. It is best if one
does it a little bit at a time so to
ensure making the best possible
choice.
Secondly, it is not always easy to
find the right information. It is important to connect with employers
who are doing what you want to do,
however those that come to the
College to recruit often do not meet
student needs. Another challenge

students face is presenting themselves. Too often they downplay
their qualifications instead ofpresenting their strengths to prospective employers.
Finally, the last difficulty people
often encounter is the lack of patience with which they approach
their new position. Students are
very often overconfident in starting a job. They expect their rise
to the top to be rapid, as they are
accustomed to utilizing and being
appreciated for their skills and intelligence. It becomes necessary,
once in the job market, to reconcile oneself to a slow but steady
ascent.

Francis doesn't think it necessary to be "terribly concerned
about what I am going to do as a
vocational outcome," but rather to
follow one's intellectual interests.
Sophomores seem to agree. As
Rachel Labush puts it, "A liberal
arts education will prepare me for
anything. Right now, it's more a
process of elimination, [finding]
what I know I don't want to do."

cleaning and decontaminating the
water even further. Earthlust took
a sample of the effluent and tested
it in a Swarthmore lab. It was fou'nd
to be considerably cleaner than the
Crum Creek.
The solid waste that has been filtered out in the WaterControl Plant
goes to the Biosolids Recycling
Center; we followed it. Two enthusiastic engineers, Doug Cowley and
Dave Morris, showed us around.
They explained that only 40 percent
of the biosolids the BRC receives
are made into compost currently,
but they continue to work on improving that figure. Since the BRC
receives solid waste from the entire Philadelphia area, 40 percent is
by no means insignificant. They
sell 20-25,000 tons of compost a
year, and give away another 5,000
tons.

The chemical content of the waste
when it enters the BRC and before
it leaves is checked. No chlorides
are used in the process; in fact, the
only chemical additive used in the
plant is a polymer that helps remove
the waste solids from the liquid.
The liquid is shipped back to the
Southwest plant. The solids are
mixed with wood chips for better
oxygenation, and then dried. After
a prescribed period of time, this
product is usable as dried fertilizer.
Earthlust was suitably impressed
with the Philadelphia sewage treatment system. The group followed
up by seeing that each area of the
Sharpies kitchen was equipped with
a disposal, and that the employees
were using them fully. Earthlust
decided that, for Swarthmore, sewage is good.

high. Nixon's power lust led him to be a grand "realpolitick" statesmen in the anarchic and anomic arena
of international affairs, but left him unrestrained in
using all his power to attack Muskie and McGovern
in the domestic arena which has laws, norms and a
constitution set up to check power abuse.
Clinton likewise has an addictive excess, a need
for affection. His early childhood consisted of a dead
father, a drunken step-father, and a mother who
dumped him with her parents with whom she was
estranged. As with Nixon, this probably spawned a
need to compensate. Hence the irresistible drive for
affection in later life. Clinton' lust for affection has
led him to changing positions to win the affection of
others. His warm and fuzzy behavior with staff and
his "love" of touching folks [Nixon hated that] are
further signs of his yen to be loved—in every way.
Overall, the early accusations of his weakness as
President are consistent with an overly developed desire for affection that clouds his actions. Recall how
he was called indecisive during his early years as
President. One view is that he was he brokering conservative policies, in part at least, so that everyone
would "like" him. As with Nixon, an excessive lust
for one value has proven counterproductive. Will it
also prove fatal?
Key Differences
"Watergate" was constructed in the partisan fight
lasting from June, 1972 to December, 1973. The
term put a frame around events that added power and
meaning to the case against Nixon's continuing in
office. Its invocation suggested a litany of"crooks"
Liddy, Gray [former FBI director], Colson, Mitchell,
Ehrlichman, Dean and so on.
All but Liddy held high posts.
So far only Clinton and Vernon
Jordan [not in government
now] are targets for possibly
misstating the truth. This degree of substantive seriousness, then, is one important
difference between Watergate
and "sexgate" [ or fill in your
favorite term]. The Nixon
crowd committed outrageous crimes. Clinton and
his friends have engaged in miscalculations [both
about sexual affairs and what to tell about them]. The
press, of course, is much more ferocious now, twenty
years after Watergate, with regard to any White House
infidelity—especially sexual. Witness Al Gore's re—

cent excoriation for his overzealous claim to have
been a character model in Segal's Love Story.
Aside from the substantive "criminality" differences, the two scandals are not equally subject to
simplification. Over time the term "Watergate"
evolved from an obscure place reference to a free
standing political symbol. It had the capacity to absorb psychologically, if not legally, related public
events. That symbol bound all of Nixon's "misdeeds" into a grand simplification . At its height
"Watergate" connected President Nixon's cabinet,
the Republican party, and the nation's security agencies to unambiguous crimes,
misdemeanors, and lies. In the
initial phases of the conflict
Watergate itself was a symbol
implicitly raising the questions
what happened and who had
done it? Exposure of taped
conversations in the oval office, by the final stages of the conflict, brought the
scandal to an end. Toward the end the word impeachment became a frequent demand component in the
Watergate symbol. After two years the public anc
Congress were ready to debate .whether the President shouldremain in office. Now, in January, 1998,
a new set of White House related tapes has
emerged—claiming a sexual affair occurred inside
the White House. Already, within days, impeachment and resignation possibilities are tripping from
reporters lips. The cycle has accelerated.
As of late January, 1998 the future of Clinton's
presidency is being debated. Resignation is, at least
for some pundits, a possibility. My estimate is that
unless there emerges some embracing condensation
symbol linking Whitewater to
a current cover-up by high officials of Presidential sex deviations, the special prosecutor will have a hard time making a case of high crimes anc
misdemeanors. An investigation by Congress, a la
Watergate, is also less probable. Capitol Hill, which is ferocious on economic issues,
has not found sex issues to its taste. They are too
hot and too close to home [Packwood, et. al.]. The
public is confused and ready to separate Presidential performance from personal rectitude. So there
are some important differences between Watergate
andSexgate [or whatever we call it]. Nixon crowc

committed serious crimes. Clinton engaged in "ler
gal" sex outside conventional rectitude. What has
occurred in the Clinton Presidency so far is miscalculations [both about sexual affairs and the press's
use of them] and, much more seriously if true, try•.
ing to cover them up.
A second difference between now and the
Watergate era is Ken Starr. He makes the contest
faced by Clinton much different than that faced by
Nixon—aside from the different public feelings that
the two Presidents evoke. Ken Starr as an "Indecounsel is no Cox or Jaworski as a pros~
ecutor acting in the public interest. Starr is a partisan
zealot. Appointed by Reagan
judges, he has sought to tie-illegality to everything he
could. He has combed the
Clintons' real estate and Arkansas finances. Starr's ef
forts to get evidence against Hillary and Bill are heroic. He has pursued dealings with the McDougals*
jailed Susan McDougal for contempt, and used a wire
[under the bra?] worn by a left-over Bush employee
to "Tripp" up Clinton with information about possible lying. This may eventually rebound against
him. Clinton .strategists are already cranking up to
shift the ground from an attack on Bill to a counter
attack on Ken. Maybe it will not work; but I wager
that five months from now Bill is in office and Ken
Starr wishes dearly that he was at Pepperdine.
How will this all turn out? Currently the news process is filled with possible candidates for a needed
"condensation" symbol. The prospective employment for neologism entrepreneurs is exceeded only
by the welfare opportunities for lawyers. I doubt
my nomination above- Sexgate—will work as the
encompassing term that simplifies Clinton's misdeeds. Whatever term emerges, however, needs
neutrality: sexgate is too "hot" a word, especially
since most adults have engaged in it. [A compara
tive note: few adults have ever done Watergate]
Alternatively, be on the watch for Billgate
Philandergate, Zippergate, Lewdgate [afte
Lewinsky?]. We probably do not even need a "gate'
word for Clinton. But do not count it out—after al
Watergate resurfaced in successor terms such as
Korea-gate, Iran-gate, India-gate.
As the Clinton strategists crankup to shift the
ground in the coming days from an attack on Bill to
a counterattack on Starr, my bet is that Ruff will play
tough and Starr will Tripp.

Jedi Plays Tricks with New LP
Worldwide Master of Gymkata

I Was sitting in Tarble interviewing
Stoupe, the producer of the new indie
hip-hop album from Jedi Mind Tricks,
and I was blown away not only by his
sincerity and humility, but also his genuine commitment to music. Although
Stoupe was not the easiest person to iivterview, we talked for a half-hour aboi<t
his latest projects, the accaim his new
album is getting, and the way he likes to
work.
Jedi Mind Tricks is one of 5 acts that
he produces for One Soul Productions,
his company, and it's the first that has
come to fruition in the form of a fulllength album. The album has been released on vinyl on Superregular Recordings, a company in which Stoupe is 1/
sth owner.
Stoupe's partner in Jedi Mind Tricks is
rapper Ikon, who also happens to be
Tarble Goddess Marianne's son. Stoupe
creates and manipulates the music, and
Ikon handles the vocals.
Jedi Mind Tricks is a unique entity that
most people in the College community

probably aren't aware of. "I don't think
many people around here know about
us," Stoupe explains. Their record,
though, is distributed internationally, and
Stoupe tells of fan mail they have received from Japan, Australia, and Denmark, among others.
The music represented on the album
is fiercely independent, and Stoupe's
guerilla musical style shines through.
"Everything you hear on that album we
did in my grandmother's bedroom."
Stoupe continued, "We could have taken
it to get mastered or changed around, but
that's not what we wanted. I don't even
like people to hear it from tapes
the
comes
off
the
wax
is
the
way it
way it
should be heard."
Things are looking up for the group.
They've been lauded in several industry
magazines, and just last weekend, Jedi
Mind Tricks finished filming their first
video, which is to be aired in the coming months on Black EntertainmentTelevision, or BET. It was shot by a professional crew in and around Philly. Stoupe
says they had a great time making it, although he thinks his few shots in the
video might end up on the cutting room
floor.
Stoupe hopes to "go all out" for JedVs
next album by releasing on CD and cassette, after, perhaps, two more single releases. There hasn't been a Jedi Mind
Tricks tour yet, but Stoupe says they're
getting offers to perform in some West
Coast venues.
"We're just trying to get it out there
and get our music heard. We're a bunch
of guys with 9 to 5 jobs, and look what
we've done."
The new album is available on vinyl
from Stoupe in Tarble for $ 10, or by calling Superregular Recordings at (6JO)

Review: Jedi Album Goes From Here To Eternity
by Patrick Boe
It's difficult to avoid displaying a certain hometown

pttde in any music that comes from members of the
Swarthmore community, but even an unbiased review
of Jedi Mind Tricks' latest album would have to be
glowing. It is difficult to be unimpressed by this new
work by DJ Stoupe and rapper Ikon the Verbal Hologram. The Psycho-Social, Chemical, Biological, and
Electro-Magnetic Manipulation ofHuman Consciousness is an epic work, in theme and in style.
From the short intra track, which recalls biblical
themes of creation, light, and darkness, it becomes
apparent that this hip-hop work will reach beyond
social messages and personal narratives to deal with
issues of grand, supernatural import. With "TheWinds
of War," The Jedis launch into a series of beautifully
murky tracks powered by Ikon's forceful vocals set
against the backdrop ofStoupe's ethereal aural atmospheres. The smooth-flowing rhymes seamlessly mix
themes of ancient history with gods, science, and sci-

ence fiction. Ikon invokes visions of Babylon, the
Temple of Artemis, the Promised Land, Pharaohs,
Stonehenge, and Atlantis side-by-side with images
of cyborgs, aliens, electro-magnetism, shamanism,
molecular biology, angels, and demons. At times,
the images can get repetitive; there is one point at
which the phrases "biochemical biosphere," and
"biochemical implants" appear scarcely two lines
from each other. At times, the listener gets the feeling that the Jedis are randomly scattering a few resonant ideas through their work in an attempt to create
a faux-intellectual sound, though they only serve to
unnecessarily complicate the verse. These problems
are easily forgiven, however, in light of the broader
feeling of the work, one that is so grand in scope
that the minutia become unimportant.
Throughout the work, the Jedis maintain a very
ominous tone. The epic themes, strongly reminiscent of those found in Dr Octagon's work, are darkened by Ikon's powerful, Spearhead-like delivery.
He pushes every line into the next with an unswerving, mechanized force. This technique works per-

KATIE MENZER
Let me introduce myself. I am a bear. For
the past 17 years, I have been living in an old,
rotting tree stump in the depths of the Crum.
It is much like living in the dormitory you call
Willets, only there is significantly less vomit.
Since there are only so many hours each day
I can spend mauling the children of faculty
and pooping in the forest, I have spent the
majority ofmy free time observing the life and
habits of Swarthmore students.
Last Saturday night, I was happily strolling
through the woods when I stumbled across several of the Phoenix staff. What they were doing, I have promised not to disclose, but let's
just say I didn't know you could convince a
squirrel to do that.
Anyway, in exchange for not gnawing off
their limbs, the staff members have given me
my own advice column. Now, on with the
show.

fectly with the subject matter, emphasizing the
weight of lines like, "The plan was to kill God and
reinvent him." More importantly, the sonic underpinnings engineered by Stoupe immerse thelistener
in a mysterious, dreamlike landscape, removed from
the physical violence of the vocals. Stoupe uses a
combination ofacoustic guitar, strings, synthesized
piano and drums, and ethereal samples to create his
spooky, isolating effect. As a result, listening to the
lyrical action is like watching a grand war from a
great distance. A mix of middle-eastern chord structures and alien disharmonies simultaneously reminds
the listener of humanity's most ancient origins and
ofrealms yet-undiscovered. The atmosphere is wellsuited to complement the epic proportions of the
subject matter.
This is not only an album that should make the
Swarthmore community proud, but also one that
serves as a strong representative for what can come
out of the independent hip-hop scene. One can only
hope that Stoupe and Ikon will keep putting out work
of the same quality.

Dear Bear,
I live in Wharton. The hall telephone is right
outside my room. Every morning, I am unpleasantly startled into consciousness by the
housekeeper's loud and penetrating voice as
she talks on the phone.
If I ask her to keep it down, I'm afraid she
will get angry at me and stop doing her muchneeded and much-appreciated job. But if I say
nothing, I am liable to die of sleep-deprivation.Whatever should I do?
Sincerely,
Reaching out to touch someone

.

•

Dear Reaching out,
You are in a very sticky situation here. You
must handle this predicament with great care,
because if you don't, you might have to...Dare
I say it?...CLEAN UP AFTER YOURSELF!
If I were you, this is what I would do:
Camouflage yourself with leaves, bushes,
and dirt. Don't be stingy with the vegetation;
you want to blend in perfectly with your surroundings. Then, go sit very quietly in a chair
in your lounge. Wait for your housekeeper to
become engrossed in her telephone conversation. At the moment she seems most relaxed
and unaware, burst forth from your shroud of
shrubbery on your hind legs, snarling and
frothing at the mouth, and leap upon her.
Quickly throw her to the ground and, before
she has a chance to scream for help, rip out
her jugular with your canine teeth. Then, after
firmly grasping her head in your mighty jaws,
drag her into the woods and feed her to your
cubs.
Of course, you're not me. Your only solution, therefore, is to "stink" her out.
The idea here is to make the environment
around the telephone so unpleasant that your
housekeeper will not want to venture near it.
Luckily for you, the environment around the
telephone is your dorm room, so your options
are wide open.
If you prefer things slow and subtle, may I
suggest several open cans of tuna fish placed
strategically around your room. Within two
weeks, the aroma billowing from beneath your
door will be so unbearable, even Wharton
cockroaches will vacate the premises.
If you'd rather a more immediate, hands-on
approach, start using your wardrobe as your
own private latrine, kind of like a water closet
but withoutall that annoying water. Leave your
door open and encourage your friends to use
your make-shift potty. Believe me, you won't
have to worry about people entering your room
to steal your stuff.
Of course, as my time stalking bloated and
nauseated students outside Sharpies has taught
me, there are many, many other ways to formulate offending odors. Be creative and have
some fun.
Note from the bear: If you would like to ask
the bear for some advice, print your question
neatly in black ink on a 3x5 index card and
bring it to the Crum around feeding time. To
ensure an immediateresponse, make sure you
are naked and bleeding.

The Swarthmore Phoenix

Memo to the
Spice Girls:
Kiss My Ass
The opening credits of
Spice World say that the
movie is 'based on an
original idea by the Spice
Girls,' and, thinking back
on this film, I have to
wonder to myself what
Altered States exactly that original idea
was. If it was to embarPatrick Runkle
rass themselves by making one of the lamest movies I have ever witnessed,
then the Spice Girls have succeeded on a grand scale.
Spice World is unbelievably unbearable. It could
not possibly be any worse, and I mean that literally
a blank screen would be an improvement. It is
dumbfoundingly unfunny and relentlessly stupid, and
the entire audience of 8-year-olds with whom I saw
Spice World sat there blank-faced for the film's entire 95 minute running time.
I'm getting ahead of myself. Spice World is the
motion picture debut of the Spice Girls, the 5-woman
British pop sensation that has become an overnight
worldwide success. The movie ostensibly follows
their backstage activities, which mostly consist of
sitting around, acting like idiots, and lip-synching.
They apparently travel around London all day long
in a gaudy double-deckerbus which is about twice as
big on the inside as it is on the outside. They have a
manager (Richard E. Grant) who is very demanding,
and they complete a rigorous daily schedule ofpracticing their songs and trying on bad outfits.
Also included in the film for no apparent reason
are Roger Moore as a god-like record company executive, George Wendt as a film producer who wants
to put the Spice Girls in a movie, and Barry
Humphries as a tabloid editor who wants to see the
Spice Girls ruined. After about 15 minutes of Spice
World, I was rooting for the tabloid editor.
I was not very familiar with the Spice Girls before
I saw Spice World, and the movie made me dislike
them passionately. Not only do they come off as
mental lightweights, they also seem to have no commitment whatsoever to their music, which, of course,
sucks anyway.
One of the Spice Girls (I don't know which) has
her tongue pierced, and itoccurred to me while watching Spice World that the movie should have been The
Spice Girls Get Their Tongues Pierced. Now that
would have been funny, or, at least, less painful to
watch than Spice World

Glass, Wood, Stone: Assembled Memories
by Alicia Googins
John Stone's mixed media exhibit,
"Assembled Memories," currently on
display at the List Gallery through February 22, provides intricate and compelling insight into the artist's life and personal reflections. Stone is an AfricanAmerican artist who grew up in Boston,
MA, studied architecture at the Parson
School of design in New York and currently lives and works in Philadelphia.
The artist's full-time job, which involves
construction management and working
with first-time homeowners, is closely
related to his artistic themes of family
roots and African-American identity.
Although many ofhis pieces are inspired
by his personal experience, the scope of
the artist's work extends to all who share
a similar heritage. Working with photographs drawn from his own family's past,
as well as from others, Stone creates fascinating mixed-media pieces which engage the viewer in deeper and deeper levels of meaning and interpretation.
In his recent gallery talk, Stone gathered with students and professors to
speak about the form, process, and message of his work. Small black and white
photographs are the compelling centers
of his pieces; they are often covered by
brass keyholes or glass and carefully
framed with aged wood to indicate their
importance. In response to one question
posed with respect to the materials he
uses, the artist explained,
"... the photographs tend to say what
materials want to be around them...
In "Welcome Home," a totem-like
piece that reaches upwards and culminates in a metal roof-shaped structure,
"

Stone demonstrates his belief that art
can grow and change. All four sides of
the wood block display photographs
taken by children from a North Philly
after-school program where Stone

Stone's pieces are immensely appealing to look at and touch, which he encourages visitors to do. Tactile and colorful media such as painted, peeling
wood, patterned wallpaper and richly

works. These images of friends and
family will be joined by others as the
piece grows and evolves. "Welcome
Home" underwent development just
before the exhibition's opening; originally too tall for theList Gallery, it was
sawed off by Stone to adjust its height.

colored fabrics invite the viewer to approach and examine each piece closely.
But after an initial glance, many of the
displays carry a darker, more disturbing message. One of the most striking
pieces in the show, entitled "a nigger is
a nigger is a nigger," consists of a

painted wooden shelf holding three simple
white plates. Suspended from the bottom
of the shelf hangs a collection of framed
pictures. On the glass covering of each
photograph the word "nigger" appears in
tiny letters, while each plate says "is a"
in the center. These carefully designed
elements engage the viewer in the diffeis
ent levels of meaning inherent to the piece
by demanding attention, reflection and reaction.
Stone emphasizes that the materials in
his pieces are very important to him because of his studies in architecture. He
finds that "the proper use ofmaterials intensifies the story," which supports the impression one gets of his work's narrative
quality. Each piece seems to tell a story:
of an individual, a family, or a people as a
whole. Many of the wooden and mefai
objects that the artist combines in his
pieces come from the actual construction
sites where he works. Stone's commitment to providing homes is demonstrated
in the common roof or house-shaped
forms that appear in his pieces. Many of
his works also use geometric forms With
juxtapositions of circles and squares and
tall linear patterns.
Stone's work is strongly influenced by
his own life. The time that he spent w(Jh
his mother as a child is clearly reflected
in pieces such as "The Kitchen Gods at
Rest" and "Diana the Goddess that Hunts
Alone." Such works have a strong arid
comforting femalepresence. There is also
a sacred element to many pieces that resemble altars or small shrines because of
a lighted candle or photograph. Stone's
synthesis of powerful themes, careful design, and reflection creates a thought-provoking and effective exhibit.

to 10, but in the end were defeated 72-52.
English posted 14 points and Marandola had
13 points and eight rebounds. Quinn had
12 points in the outing.
The string of defeats earned the Garnet
fifth place in theEastern division of theCentennial Conference, right between Haverford
(2-6) and Bryn Mawr (0-9). The Mules are
in the top spot with a 5-2 record, followed
by Washington (4-4), and Ursinus (3-5). The
Garnet have seven conference games remaining on their schedule though, six of
which are against opponents in their division, providing plenty of timeand opportunity for Swat to jump up in the standings.
Young voicedthe positive attitude that bolsters the team, "I think we're tougher mentally and we're playing better together. The
team is showing a lot more confidence.

We've been so close so many times that I'm
just looking forward to when it comes together for us in a big game because we all
know we can do it.... The next time we face
those teams, they're going down."
Several individuals on the team are holding their own in the overall conference statistics. Marandola is eighth in the conference in scoring, averaging just under 13
points a game and second in the conference
in steals, grabbing 3.1 a contest. Michelle
Walsh '9B is fourth in the conference, averaging 2.8 steals a game. English is tied for
ninth in the conference, dishing out 2.7 assists per contest, and Quinn ranks third in
the conference in rebounding, pulling down
an average of 10.2 boards a game.
The team will play Rosemont before returning to conference action. They host the

This past weekend Swarthmore wrestlers
faced tough Centennial Conference competition at a quad meet hosted by Johns Hopkins.
Swarthmore faced Johns Hopkins, Gettysburg,
and Muhlenberg. Swarthmore defeated Johns
Hopkins 28-24, lost a close one to Mulenberg
24-28, and lost to Gettysburg 6-40.
Gettysburg finished the day on top defeating
the other three teams, while Swarthmore,
Muhlenberg, and Johns Hopkins all finished
1-2.
Pete Balvanz, '9B, and Alejandro Montero,
'OO, both went 3-0, while Ben Gaines, 'Ol,
finished 2-0. Balvanz had a win by pin, decision, and forfeit. Montero won all three by
decision, and Gaines pinned for both wins.
The team is beginning to improve on both
an individual and general level. "I felt like I
wrestled better on Saturday than at any other
time so far this season, I was more aggressive," said Sam Picard, 'Ol. The wrestlers are
also satisfied with the hard work everyone is
contributing. "I'm thrilled about what the
team as a whole accomplished, all the hard
work is starting to come together, granted
there were a few disappointments, but all in
all we have improved tremendously and we're
on pace for a good showing at conferences."
said Montero.
Swarthmore will face Centennial Conference rivals Ursinus and Western Maryland this
weekend at a quad meet hosted by Washington and Lee.

Mixed Week for Swat Swimmers
Ends with Men's, Women's Wins
by Mark Friedberg
This week was a mixed bag for the
Swarthmore women's swim team. Still
recovering from their trouncing at the
hands of Johns Hopkins, they narrowly
succumbed to Dickinson last Saturday,
103-102. Down but not out, the Garnet
women quickly regrouped to post a convincing 153-49 win against Bryn Mawr
on Wednesday night. The men's squad,
on the other hand, faced little competition from Dickinson and none at all from
the Mawrters, crushing the former 13951.
Dickinson has not historically posed a
serious threat to Garnet women. However, an unfortunate combination of injuries and leaves of absence has left Swarthmore scrambling to fill crucial slots in
its roster. This momentary weakness,
combined with Dickinson's recent improvements, paved the way for Saturday's
upset.
Still, Dickinson's victory was anything
but easy. Swarthmore sprinted to an early
lead with wins by Molly Marino '9B in
the 200 free, Erica Rosenthal 'OO in the
200 1.M., and an all-star 400 medley re-

lay of Kristen Robertson '9B, Jenny
Harvey '99, Cathy Polinsky '99, and Liz
Blair 'OO. Dickinson turned the tide in
the second halfof the meet with solid wins
in the sprint and distance freestyle events,
but Swarthmore continued to keep the
contest close. Robertson, in what was
easily the closest race of the day, won the
200 backstroke by three hundredths of a
second while Harvey pulverized her competition in the 200 breaststroke. Elizabeth Newcomb's 'OO amazing finish in the
200 fly earned her a third place and lifetime best time. Despite these heroic efforts, Dickinson sealed the upset by
besting the Garnet's 400 free relay.
The men's meet, in contrast, was never
close. The Garnet men thoroughly dominated their competition from start to finish, consciously avoiding a complete shutout by entering swimmers in off-events.
Among the standout swims were Chris
Seaman's '99 and Brent Wasser's 'OO uncontested4001.M.'s and Carl Sanders' '9B
close win in the 50 free. In a fitting finish, Swarthmore fielded two 200 free relays in an otherwise empty pool.
Wednesday was payback time, in more
ways than one. For the women, it was a

chance to break their uncharacteristic losing streak. This they did, punishing Bryn
Mawr in every event. Similar to men's
tactics against Dickinson, the women entered off-events. Seniors Kristen
Robertson and Molly Marino surprised
Swat with their strengths in distance
freestyle and butterfly, respectively. Notably, Marni Schultz made the conference
cut in the 400 1.M., while Newcomb
posted another lifetime best in the same
race.
For the men, it was time for the most
ferocious race of the year, an event pitting brother against brother, a scene of the
most shameful sort of trash-talk: the traditional 100 I.M. challenge. When the
smoke cleared, Andy Robbins '9B
emerged victorious and immediately
commenced a display of sportsmanship
that turned heads and raised eyebrows all
the way down the Mawter line.
And lest no lessons be learned from the
Super Bowl victory, the Garnet swimmers
have high hopes for this weekend's contest at Gettysburg. Like Elway, the seniors have lost their last three meets
against their archrival. But judging by
last Sunday, the fourth time's a charm.

The Garnet faced a tough week, dropping three straight conference games to
Ursinus, Western Maryland, and
Muhlenberg. While the team has been
playing well and has taken many competitors by surprise, this latest skid takes them
to 4-10 overall, 1 -7 in theCentennial Conference.
On paper, the Garnet were not expected
to fare as well as they did, falling to the
Bears by a slim margin, 59-54. Threepoint shooting guard Holly Barton '99 had
just departed for Russia, and point-guard
Kristen English 'Ol was sidelined with a
knee injury. However, these factors did

over the primary ball handling duties and
still poured in a career-high 22 points.
Gwyneth Horton 'OO did a fine job as
well, driving to the basket and hitting key
shots.
Swat traveled to Western Maryland last
Saturday, where they lost to the Green
Terror, 63-50. WM fielded a deep, athletic squad who worked the ball well. The
Garnet were only one point behind at the
half, but a flat defensive spell propelled
the Terror to go on a run which extended
their lead to as many as 20.

A terrific season seems to be in the
works for the women's badminton. The
first week of matches ended with a 1-1
record as the team narrowly fell to
Albright and slammed their way to a win
against Bryn Mawr.
The team left Bryn Mawr on Wednesday night with a convincing 3-2 win under their belt. Both doubles teams were
victorious, with first doubles Jennifer
Chen '99 and Erika Johansen '99 smashing their way to victory. The first game
ended with a quick win for the juniors.
After a hard and disappointing second
game, Chen and Johansen regained their
cool with a vengeance for a final scoring
of 15-8, 10-15, 15-10.
Herrin Hopper '9B and Jennifer Klein
'9B, entering their second year at second
doubles, scored the next win for Swarthmore with a final score of 15-9, 15-11.
The third and final win was scored by
Wendy Kemp '99 at second singles.
Kemp lost the first game 2-11, but rallied
back to win the next two 11 -2,11 -8. First
singles Tarn Doan '9B battled long and
hard, but fell to her BMC opponent 3-11,
6-11 while third singles Ani Hsieh '99
also lost, but played well considering it
was only her second time as a starting
singles player.
On the previous Thursday, the team
hosted Albright. Despite valiant efforts,
Swarthmore lost the first game of the season with a disappointing 2-3 final score.
Doan at first singles fell to her opponent
6-11, 1-11, while Kemp at second managed to prolong the match before losing

The woes of the men's basketball team
continued this week after dropping both
games against Western Maryland and Philadelphia Pharmacy, a NAIA scholarship
school. The Garnet Tide could not take
advantage of its first back-to-back home
games of the season, and fall to 0-16 on the
year, a school record for futility at the start
of a season. Main problem areas, according to coaches and players, have been the
inability to play consistently for 40 minutes,
as well as trouble on defense.
On Saturday, the Tide began sluggish once
again and fell behind 16-2 after just three
minutes. From there, it would be all catchup, but the Tide slowly erased the deficit
and were down just 11 at the half. The offense, led by junior Tim Schofield's 25
points, kept pouring it on and eventually,
the Tide closed the lead to 50-47. Unfortunately, the Green Terror dominated the inside and shot 61 % from the floor and eventually ran away with an 80-69 victory.
On Wednesday, Swarthmore came out
gunning against a 16-1 Pharmacy squad that
had been averaging 79 points a game coming into the contest. Swarthmore opened
with a 12-4 lead, with junior J.J Purdy scoring 7 points, before the score was finally
knotted at 22 halfway through the period.
Fouls were a problem as Pharmacy took
advantage of 12 first half fouls committed
by Swat and shot 15 of 18 from the line allowing a 43-34 lead at halftime.
Swarthmore began the second half with a
hot hand as they went on a short run that
cut the lead to 54-47. Unfortunately that
would be as close as the Garnet would get
as Pharmacy went on a 24-4 run to break
the game wide open. Pharmacy made 29
of 38 foul shots compared to Swarthmore's
4 of 7.
Schofield continued his hot streak by
pouring in 30 points, his third straight game
with at least 25. Senior Doug Rouse came
off the bench to go 4-4 from three point
range for twelve points, while junior Mike
Schall pulled in a career high 10rebounds
to go along with 5 assists.
"We haven't been able to put an entire
game together yet," commented sixth man
Joe Culley 'OO. "We can go ten minutes or
even an entire half of good basketball, but
we have to put it all together."
Associate coach Kurk Daulerio '95, in the
midst of watching film of the 16-0 run that
Swarthmore allowed in the second half
against Pharmacy, echoed the thoughts of
Culley: "We start playing well and keep the
game close and are within a few points, but
then we have a few breakdowns and the
other team goes on a big run and blow us
out. It's real frustrating for everyone."
Assistant coach Aaron Bond '97 also
pointed out that "we've been playing lousy
defense. We've been scoring close to 70
points a game yet we still lose." In terms of
statistics, Swarthmore is ranked last in the
conference allowing 75 points a game while
their field goal percentage defense is the second worst at 48%. Swarthmore has especially been having troubles in the paint, getting out-rebounded by an average of 10
board,; a game. There is an obvious lack of
heigh,, as Swarthmore really starts three
guaro s and two small forwards.
Swarthmore has been shooting only 35%
from the field, but that is also the result of
leading the conference in three point attempts. The Tide shot 11 -23 from behind
the arc in the Pharmacy game. But the Garnet need some consistency in their offense.
"At times we will push the ball when the
opportunity isn't there, or we will force turnovers by making bad passes" added coach
Daulerio.
Though the team searches for its first win,
there is still a feeling of optimism. "We
haven't played up to our capabilities. We
have shown that we can play good basketball. There are teams in the conference that
we can beat" added Culley, looking at future games against Gettysburg on Saturday,
and Haverford and Urinus next week. "We
have talent, it's just a matter of putting it
together for 40 minutes" added Daulerio on
the hopes of winning soon.
The J.V. squad will play at 5:30 tomorrow before the 7:30 start to the varsity game
against Gettysburg. The Garnet then travel
to arch-rival Haverford Wednesday night.
