Three students
arrested at
WEF protests

A Public Safety officer examines the water storage tank in the ML basement after it broke on Saturday.

ML water tank bursts,
Willets heating fails
BY MATTHEW FITTING
mfittinl@swarthmore.edu
Two unrelated facilities accidents last weekend left residents of Mary Lyon with brown water
for about a day and residents of the west side of
Willets without heat for nearly a week.
A leak developed in one of the water storage
tanks in the ML basement late Saturday night, an
accident that caused flooding for about 45 minutes
until Public Safety stopped water flow to the leaking tank. According to Ralph Thayer, director of
maintenance, the leak "did not affect the residents," and though the accident was "a spectacular gusher," students in ML were never without
hot water.
"The water, for a while, looked like apple
juice," Molly Manvel, an RA in Mary Lyon, said.
But she also praised Public Safety's quick reaction to the incident, which took place Saturday
night and was fixed by the next day. "They did a
good job," she said.
The patch put in place by

Public Safety will
hold for now, Thayer said. But a reconfiguration
of the tanks will be necessary. The current plan is
to replace the current two tanks with four new
ones, which will make the tanks easier to fix
when one breaks. Thayer said this reconfiguration will likely take place during spring break.
In Willets, a pump that had controlled the dormitory heating system for about 40 years finally
stopped working. The pump had controlled the
dorm's heat by switching on and off. Some time
before Sunday, when the problem was reported, it
stopped switching. A complaint was lodged
Sunday, and on Tuesday maintenance workers
identified the broken pump as the problem. As of
yesterday, heat had been restored.

THE PHOENIX

Though the problem was reported this Sunday,
Thayer said the heat "might have been going on

and off over the winter," which is why the heat in
Willets has been subpar.
For residents of Willets west, the lack of heat
on some of the coldest days of the year thus far

was an unwelcome surprise.
"It was freezing," Clarissa Rappoport-Hankins
'O5, a Willets second floor resident said. "We lit
around 20 candles and sort of sat around it like a
bonfire" to keep warm.
"I'm from Florida," Jeff Rogg 'O5, a Willets
third floor resident, added. "I can't take it."
"[Monday] night we wore two pairs of socks
and long underwear and jeans and sweaters and
robes and mittens," Rappoport-Hankins said.
"The worst part was this morning when I woke
up, because I had to wake up for an 8:00 bio lab,
and usually the showers are cold, too. It was
awful."
But storage tanks and heat pumps are not the
only problems facilities has had to deal with lately. The bells in Clothier tower are once again
working only on a limited basis, much to the chagrin of some students who have problems with
being punctual.

"That's an ongoing problem," Thayer said
about the bells. "We get them working, they go off,
we get them working, they go off."
Several students grumbled about the lack of a
timely reminder every 15 minutes.
"I would say they need to be rebuilt," said
Thayer. The bells currently in place were built in
the early 'Bos, and the maintenance director said
they were sorely in need of some fixing up. He
added that he was trying to obtain the funds to do
this some time in the near future, possibly this

summer.

February 7, 2002

Three students who went with the Swarthmore Progressive
Activism Committee to protest the World Economic Forum in New
York City this weekend were arrested Sunday in relation to nonpermitted protests against the WEF.
New York City police arrested Jessica Colman 'O5, Greg Holt 'O5 and
Jesse O'Brien 'O3 shortly after 1:30 p.m. on Sunday afternoon as they
participated in an illegal protest and march through Manhattan's
Lower East Side. The three students were part of a group of 87 people
who, according to Monday's New York Times, were arrested after
"raucous demonstrations took over stretches of the East Village."
Colman was arraigned late Monday on one misdemeanor charge of
obstructing government administration and two violations of disorderly conduct and parading without a permit. O'Brien was arraigned
on Tuesday afternoon, and he faces charges similar to those of Colman.
Holt was charged with only the misdemeanor and disorderly conduct.
He was released late Tuesday evening after spending more than 50
hours in jail.
"The charges against us were completely ridiculous," said Colman.
"We were merely exercising our first amendment rights."
Colman, Holt and O'Brien had traveled to New York on Saturday
afternoon with a group of approximately 20 other Swarthmore
students. The purpose of the trip was to protest the WEF meetings.
"The WEF was a gathering of the heads of the thousand biggest
multinational corporations and most important heads of state," Gabe
Hetland 'O3 said. "It was a very exclusive gathering that was really just
a place for people to network and lay the grounds for future world economic decisions."
The protest on Saturday was a permitted rally in Central Park
followed by a march down Manhattan to the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel,
where the conference delegates were staying.
"The protest was on the one hand against the existence of the WEF,"

College plans land use
BY ELIZABETH WRIGHT
ewrightl@swarthmore.edu

Prompted by a request from
the borough council, the college
is preparing plans for how it
may want to use the land it owns
over the next 50 years.
With facilities projects set for
only the next ten years and no
firm way to anticipate future
needs, the college is looking for
ways to ensure flexibility for
new construction projects.
"We're assuming there will be

continued growth," Director of
Facilities Larry Schall said.
Facilities projects for the next
10 years, including the science
center expansion and the new
dorm, are set.
Schall said it is not possible to
know exactly how the college
will grow in the future but that it
makes sense to look at past patterns.
The college grew in developed
land use 50 percent over the past
30 years, he said, partly due to
enrollment increases but mostly
due to expansion and improve-

ment of facilities, including the
performing arts center and new

athletics facilities.
The three areas at the focus of
long term plans are the unzoned
land on the far side of Crum
Creek, land currently zoned as
residential and used for faculty
housing, and the land for the
proposed college-owned hotel.
Rezoning faculty housing
land has already emerged as a
point of contention.
Based on the concerns of fac-

ulty that there should be a more

formalized process for making
long-term land use decisions, a

committee including faculty and
students has formed.
Permitting the college a range
of land use possibilities will

mean requesting zoning changes

and possibly creating a new zoning category beyond the current
residential or institutional use

designations,

according

to

Schall.
If approved

by the council,
those changes could be made

February 7,

In response to a declining
black enrollment at
Swarthmore over the last
two years, Jim Bock,
director of admissions,
worked closely with SASS
to recruit. The efforts seem
to have paid off: this year
there was a 43 percent
jump in applications from
black students.

college, along with
Wesleyan, leads small

African-American students. This number rose 48 percent at
Swarthmore from 1995 to 1998 and has
remained between eight and nine percent of the total population since then.
Yet Jim Bock '9O, director of admissions and financial aid, said during
during his seven years here, "the college has been committed to a minimum
of 10 percent African-American
enrollment for each entering class."
There were no official quotas for
admission of black students, he said.
But last year, the number of black
applicants to Swarthmore dropped
"significantly," SASS executive board
member and admissions intern Joe
Dickerson 'O4 said. Because of this, the
organization has participated more
heavily in recruiting.
"If we don't make an effort, we
might not be able to say" that our
numbers are high, SASS secretary
Audrey Dorelien 'O4 pointed out,
adding that many students whom she
believes would thrive at Swarthmore

College activists may seek umbrella budgeting group
BY MARY MINTEL

mmintell@swarthmore.edu

Jeff Regier 'O3, Student Groups
Advisor, wants to create a Forum for
Activism that would change the way
activist groups are funded and organized. The effort is presently still in the
discussion phase.
The charter states that the FA would

exist to serve politically progressive
activist groups. Its main goals would be to
make budgeting
more appropriate
through the use of more frequent budgeting, less restrictive subcodes and specialized budgeters. The FA would also help
foster cooperation between the different
groups and help revitalize those that are
failing.
Regier recognized the need for the FA
when as a first-year. He was a member of
the College Democrats, a group suffering

Earthlust expressed some reservations about the FA at their meeting on
Monday night. They felt that the fact that
it is only for progressive groups is a bit
exclusive. They were also concerned that
its main purpose might be to save the
SBC time by lumping the small activist
groups together. A few members worried
that the FA might just help the weaker
groups, at the expense of the stronger

ones.

"The general sense of Earthlust is

this is not a concern for them.
"We're not rejecting it, we just need
more information and justification to do
this," he said.
One group that is not presently discussing the FA is the College Republicans.
They are not considered progressive and,
as a result, were not contacted about being
involved in the FA.

The FA won't become a reality for a
while yet, if at all. "This is an idea we'll be
discussing more," Liane Rice 'O3, a member of the Charter Committee, said.
The SBC also feels that it is too early to
form an opinion on the FA.
Despite the uncertainty felt by many,
Reiger will continue to be persistent. He
doesn't think that anyone has realized the
full potential of the FA. "When groups

He is doing all he can to push the

selected activist groups are in the process

Athletes voice concerns at fireside chat
BY BRENDAN KARCH
bkarchl@swarthmore.edu

Athletes spoke out about scheduling conflicts at a fireside chat hosted by student members of the Athletics
Review Committee (ARC) Monday night.
The student-only chat was part of an effort by the ARC
to gather opinions on issues of campus athletics culture.
While the chat was intended for both athletes and nonathletes, the roughly 30 students in attendance were
almost all participants in varsity or club sports.
The group focused on specific scheduling conflicts
between athletics and other activities. Dining hall hours,
faculty lectures and labs were singled out as problem
areas where real progress would be most possible.
Athletes at the meeting complained that the dining
hall often starts removing food before the 7:15 p.m. closing time. Student ARC member and tri-varsity athlete

Katie Tarr 'O2 said she has already brought up the issue
with the ARC and will push for a schedule where food
stays out later.
"It will be my last mission before I graduate to get food
in Sharpies until 7:15 or 7:30," Tarr said. "I've talked to
coaches about this numerous times," she added, "and it
appears this has been a problem for many years."
With faculty lectures, most athletes admitted they

would rarely miss practice for a lecture unless the lecture
was required. The majority of lectures take place during
afternoon practice times. But Dean of the College Bob
Gross '62, who was present for part of the meeting, noted

6

that shifting lectures to the evening would not solve the
problem, since teams often practice after dinner.
Students agreed on a more flexible and varied program
for lectures, with the possibility of lunchtime scheduling.
Inflexibility in laboratory sessions was another concern. In labs offered on multiple days of the week, students said they would like to have priority in choosing
on athletic schedules.
At an ARC meeting tomorrow, student members of the
committee will bring up the content of Monday's meeting.
Scheduling conflicts are, however, only one part of the
campus culture issue that the ARC is addressing. The
committee is also looking at campus-wide opinion of athdays based

letes and stigmas attached to athletics.
Student ARC members present at the chat asked students about these issues. But with the crowd consisting of
virtually all athletes and with few comments from nonathletes, there was little debate about opinion toward athletes or stigmas attached to them. Those in attendance
seemed concur that there was little or no stigma.
Brandon Silverman 'O2 said the lack of non-athletes at
the meeting likely suggests apathy toward athletics on
the part of most students. The student ARC members
were disappointed by the lack of attendance from nonathletes.
"We should have thought about advertising it a little
differently," ARC member Jeremy Slezak 'O2 said.
Slezak was cautious in deeming the meeting a success.
"It reaffirmed my belief that getting athletes and non-athletes together might be beneficial," he said.

Opinions
Unite all activists
For the first time in a long time, a proposal to change the way
Swarthmore student groups are run is on the docket. Student
Council's Student Groups Adviser, Jeff Regier 'O3, has come up with
a proposal to create a forum that would make budgeting more
appropriate for small activist groups. The forum would also serve
as an advocate for all progressive activist student groups (see story,
Pg-

5).

While concerns about fairness and political favorites are valid,
the idea of an umbrella organization to help activist groups is a
good one. And if organizations like Forum for a Free Press (FFFP)
and Cooperative Involvement and Volunteers in Communities
(CIVIC) can administer budgeting responsibly and fairly, so could
this Forum for Activism.
The proposed Forum for Activism (FA) would allow small, politically progressive groups to have a more flexible budgeting schedule
and a more cohesive presence on and off campus.
"It could eliminate a lot of the difficulties that small activist
groups might face if they wanted to become a larger part of the campus voice," Feminist Majority treasurer Andrew Verardo 'O4 said.
Many groups, with good reason, seem to be uncomfortable with
the idea of increased bureaucracy and decreased autonomy. But in
reality, budgeting would be simpler when worked out with a forum
that is familiar with activist causes and needs.
A minor increase in bureaucracy seems a small price to pay for

both the strong, unified voice and emergency money in the budget
for such things as unplanned off-campus protests.
Keeping student groups strong is difficult at a place like
Swarthmore student commitment is a limited and fluctuating
variable, and institutional memory is short. The smaller the group,
the harder it is to keep contacts and activities afloat.
Regier's proposal, however, is hugely flawed in one way: it is not
broad enough in scope. Why limit the forum's concerns to only
activists with a leftist slant? The proposed Forum for Activism
should not include only politically progressive groups. If the College
Democrats are involved, the College Republicans should be as well;
if the Pro-Choice Task Force is included, so should the Swarthmore
Students Advocating Life. Political activism groups have much to
learn from opposing viewpoints. The forum could contribute much
to the vitality of student's experience with campus activism if it
encouraged the form of engagement in addition to strengthening
and supporting individual groups.

Lounging around
The new SCCS Media Lounge will open to the student body in
about a week. The lounge will provide more computers, a Sony
PlayStation 2 and digital cameras available for rent. The student
body should be excited about everything the lounge will provide,
but we have waited too long for this space to open.
The SCCS Media Lounge is not a new idea. The proposal first
appeared in 1999, when students voted on what would become of
Sharpies 111, now the T Kaori Kitao Gallery. SCCS lost that election
but eventually triumphed over proposals for activist space and the
Swa-Wa convenience store in November of 2000, earning the right to
remodel the old Tarble gameroom.
As of last April, SCCS expected to open the lounge by the start of
the current academic year. Unfortunately, the opening kept moving
back, and it has been nearly two and a half semesters since the
media lounge won the election. If a similar election happens in the
future, the college must work better with the student group backing
the winning proposal to make sure that there are fewer delays.
Also, although SCCS now has its own area, the two groups that
lost the vote for the control of the Tarble gameroom space still need
space on campus. SCCS argued during the election that activists
could use space in Wharton basement and that latenight Tarble
hours which would ultimately fail from lack of interest would
serve Swa-Wa's purpose. Activists still do not have the space they
requested, and there is still nowhere to buy food on campus after

Tarble closes.
For the short time that Tarble actually was open until 2 a.m., students did not buy enough food at night for the college to keep running the service. Many students, however, said that they would
have purchased food if it had been of higher quality. There is still
significant support for a Swa-Wa on campus, but if we are to have
one, we need more student space. The activists also need more
space, especially since Parrish, where they meet most frequently,
will soon be under construction.
In order to alleviate space problems for student groups, the college must open more spaces to student group development and help
the groups to complete any remodeling they might need as quickly
as possible.

letter to the editor

Career services must
expand programs
Dear Editor,
I am writing in response to the article "Seniors face recession and weaker job market." Career Services Director Tom
Francis was quoted as saying, "It doesn't feel dramatically
different. What somebody might write about in The New
York Times applies less to Swarthmore. We tend to focus
more on the individual, and less on external factors." Many
of us at Swarthmore entertain this ivory tower perspective
from time to time. Unfortunately, this optimism is detached
from the reality experienced by myself and many other graduating seniors. Noticeably fewer companies have visited
Swarthmore this year. Those who came offered employment
to fewer students than in the past. This recession has forced
companies to look for candidates with "directly applicable"
degrees rather than risk hiring someone with a liberal arts
degree(especially one in the humanities). Mr. Francis is also
quoted as saying, "Swarthmore [graduate application rates]
doesn't correlate with economic cycles." It may prove misleading to claim this non-relationship based solely upon the
behavior of this year's class. Graduate school application is
time sensitive. One does not just apply on a whim. Exams,

applications and recommendations do not allow it.
Some may take pride in the fact that Swarthmore exists in
a "bubble," but students have to leave the nest someday. For
those who are not lucky enough to graduate debt-free and
who will be losing their health insurance after graduation, a
competitive and continually improving Career Services is of
critical importance. Swarthmore prepares students well who
want to receive advanced degrees, but what about those for

whom graduate school is unsuitable or undesirable?
Swarthmore's relative anonymity in the private sector
should spur Career Services to be all the more aggressive on
our behalf. Career Services does offer a few programs, and I
have availed myself of video-taped interviews, alumni informationals and externships. While these programs hold promise, unless they are enhanced, their full capacity will never
be realized. Companies currently have an incentive to cut off
this small and relatively unknown school. Once that happens, even a pretty resume will not salvage the opportunity
that has been lost.
Lax attitudes inevitably lead to diminishing or stagnating
quality. For all that it purports itself to be, Swarthmore and
its institutions should always be striving for more.

Corrections
In last week's issue, the story
"Medical transportation woes not likely
to be solved" (pg. 4) incorrectly stated
that Anna Stratton 'O4 was transported
to Crozer-Chester Medical Center by
Public Safety after falling off a ladder.
In fact, she was taken there by ambulance. The story also incorrectly states
that Stratton was picked up from the
hospital by Public Safety, but she was
actually picked up by a student driver
called by Worth Health Center.
•

In last week's issue, the jump from
the pg. 3 story "Council secretary
resigns" was missing. The following is
the missing text from the article.
"The duties specific to secretary are
not particularly difficult or time-consuming," council co-president Matt
Rubin 'O3 said. "We just need someone
who is very excited and interested to
be on council."
Temporarily, Rubin has taken over
the secretary's duties of recording and
posting minutes while co-president
Liane Rice 'O3 has taken over the secretary's duties as treasurer.
"I don't think [the resignation] will
affect the proceedings [of the council]
as the elections are happening very
soon," said Rice. "It's not as if we're
missing someone who goes to meetings with administrators."
Singreen and the current members
of Student Council met each other last
semester after the elections at a meeting of the outgoing council. Singreen

would respect any other student's
decision."

Saturday's WEF protests a hopeful sign
BY MAYA SCHENWAR
At the World Economic Forum
in New York on Sunday, four
Swatties were arrested. They were
protest

taken while protesting peacefully,
committing no crime. They were
wrongfully held in jail for two days.
Sunday's circumstances were a
product of over-policing and unnecessarily
tightened
security.
However, the 150 arrests that took
place on Sunday do not overshadow
the positive aspects of the rest of the
weekend's protests: the surprisingly
small amount of police interference
on Thursday, Friday and Saturday
and the overall nonviolent nature of
the WEF rrotests. For at least a little

while, the values of peace and civil
rights were respected this past
weekend
by both sides involved.
At Saturday's permitted protest,
I thought there would be violence. I
thought there would be oppressive
police action, rocks thrown at windows. Although I felt it was important to go, I thought I would come
away from the experience even
more disillusioned with the directions both the nation and the left are
taking. I was wrong.
Sure, there were the police lining
every inch of the march's route. Of
course there were the pockets ofpeople protesting everything not related to the WEF. Yet, for the most part,
police maintained their place on the
sidelines, and the "Free Mumia"
group was tiny compared to the
thousands of people directing thenenergies against the WEF and the
corporations it stands for.
At last year's WEF protests in
Melbourne, brutal police violence
erupted, and 400 protesters were
injured. At the large-scale anti-glob-

THE PHOENIX

alization protests in Prague, Genoa
and Seattle, violence was expected,

and violence happened. People died.
Hundreds were arrested. This weekend, no one was injured.
After the Melbourne protests,
Australian state Premier Steve
Bracks attacked the demonstrators,

calling them"absolutely disgraceful"

and saying they "deserved the criticism of all Australians." He said it
was "not acceptable in the way we
operate in Australia." I'd like to
think that, in America, there is no
defined "way we operate." I'd like to
think that the freedoms our nation
was supposedly founded on still
apply. After all, aren't those freedoms the basis of our "patriotism"

in the first place?
A resounding "yes" was the
answer I got when, after the protest,
a few of us Swatties chatted with a
group of police outside Starbucks, as
the other members of our group
exploited the evil corporation for its
bathroom. To be sure, the cops were
not 100 percent happy about the
protests, reminding us,"This city's
been through a lot." Yet they wholeheartedly acknowledged our right to
be out there, exercising our freedom
of speech. It's refreshing to see that
docile patriotism has not become a
mandate, even in New York.
All this is wonderful news, but
the biggest surprise arrived when I
got back from the protest and went
online to read about it. I was
pumped, all set to get mad about the
biased, corporate-ruled perspective
of mainstream media. Yet my scrutinizing eyes were greeted with a set
of articles that was
for the first
fair.
time in months, it seemed
There was even a quote from the
NYPD spokesman, saying of the pro-

testers, "They've been wonderful." I
don't know where all the love came
from. Maybe it was just an off-day.
(Sunday's events testify to this possibility.) But for the first time in
quite a while, I felt like I lived in a
country where I could hold againstthe-grain beliefs and act on them
without being labeled a lunatic, a

delinquent or, worse, a "college stu-

dent."

Protests are supposed to be wakeup calls. They are supposed to
remind you that the world is going
to hell. So perhaps I should focus on
the bad aspects of the WEF protest

the overabundance of police, the
fact that we were blocked from actually

approaching

the

Waldorf-

Astoria (where the

WEF members
were staying). Maybe I should focus
on the activists who, in the wake of
shouts of "Starbucks sucks!" and
"End corporate greed," enjoyed a
well-earned post-protest Caramel
Macchiato and a big-name cigarette.
Of course, I could focus on the injustice of Sunday's arrests and the general injustice of the "justice system."
Yet, for me, Saturday's protest
was a reassurance, if a reassurance
much-tempered by the events of
Sunday.
It told me that living in America
still guarantees me more civil lib-

erties than much of the world
even as those liberties
enjoys
are being limited. It reminded me
that there are many people out
there willing to exercise those liberties to their full capacity
peacefully. It told me that this
country just might have a chance.
Of course, I still think the world is
on its way to hell. But maybe, just
maybe, it's moving slower than I
thought.

Classifying al-Qaida
prisoners: some ideas
Is there any institution more foolish, short-sighted and prone to
hysteria than the British press? Here's a selection of their recent
headlines about the treatment of al-Qaida prisoners at Guantanamo
Bay. "Terrorism used as excuse for inhumanity." "Tortured." "Bring
our sons home, say shocked families." And as soon as they had
begun their crusade, European MPs and human rights groups
jumped on board. All this because the Army wanted to be extra careful when transporting people whose specialty is hijacking planes.
However, all this sound and fury did bring up one good point, as
silly debates will sometimes do. Although the concerns about cruel
treatment at Guantanamo Bay were one part hot air and one part
reflexive anti-Americanism, it is
true that the prisoners are being
held in a legal no man's land with
no definitive status. If the government's going to get about the vital
business of investigating, prosecuting and punishing this scum, that
needs to change. Unfortunately, the

problems.

The Price of Liberty j like, but I think telling a suspect,
"We'll make you watch Carrot Top
if you don't say where the nerve
gas is" is acceptable if it mght save lives.
The Bush administration's stance is that the prisoners should be
classified as "battlefield detainees," a phrase that makes it sound
like they're in captivity because some dorky hall monitor squealed
on them for throwing spitballs near Tora Bora. Because the Geneva
Convention rules don't apply to international terrorist organizations, Bushies say a new category is needed. Critics say the administration's word games have placed prisoners in a legal limbo where
they have no rights at all.
The administration has never been particularly good at addressing issues like these. Rumsfeld has rightly and repeatedly insisted
that the prisoners are being kept in humane conditions, but he's
brushed aside any concerns about their civil rights. He reminds me
of the Union Captain from "The Outlaw Josie Wales" who, when reprimanded for his harsh treatment of some Confederate POWs,
retorts, "They were decently treated! They were decently fed, decently housed and then decently shot." Legally, morally and PR-wise,
this sort of thing just won't fly.
If America is to fulfill its goals ofprosecuting suspected terrorists
and getting its allies to shut their pie-holes, the al-Qaida prisoners
need a proper legal definition. Ideally, it should be one which balances their right to due process and the government's right to effectively wage war on terrorism.
We could do away with words and give the prisoners numbers, as
in the classic British TV series "The Prisoner." Instead of referring
to "prisoners of war" or "illegal combatants" or what have you, we
would just say, "numbers 11 through 169." Adopting a numerical
ranking system like that ofThe Island would help clarify American
politics by setting down a pecking order in the administration,
wherein Dick Cheney is number one, George W. Bush number two,
Don Rumsfeld number three, and Colin Powell number one billion.
Or, Bush could follow Reagan's lead and classify al-Qaida as a
vegetable. As far as I know, there is no onerous international law
concerning the interrogations of produce. But there is some danger
associated with this approach. If al-Qaida is considered a vegetable,
the Axis of Evil may manage to revitalize their flagging economies
by demanding billions of dollars in farm subsidies.
We could say that all of the prisoners are mentally ill individuals
who have been involuntarily committed to a government-run insane
asylum at Guantanamo Bay. This has the advantage of being plausible. The prisoners have to be at least a little nutzoid to have thought
that their small, internationally deplored army of mountain men
armed with Soviet-era equipment would prevail against a global
superpower packing AC-130 gunships and Daisy Cutter bombs.
One final option is to classify al-Qaida fighters as children.
Technically, even the most battle-hardened mujahadeen is someone's child. And since children are generally accorded fewer legal
rights than adults, this phrasing would give the administration
plenty of discretion for holding and trying the terrorist suspects. It
would also give the administration a swell new euphemism.
Bombing terrorist facilities.wouldn't just be a military strike, it
be a sign of their resolve to "leave no child behind."
Ah, heck. Maybe that Union Captain was right all along.

The WEF: Is protest the final solution?
True global change demands thought, Weekend's protests full of meaningless
not just multi-city demonstrations
slogans, self-important rich kids
Life at Swarthmore is full of split images and ironies. One day, I'm protesting the World
Economic Forum in New York with more than fifteen Swatties, walking back and forth
across midtown Manhattan in the middle of a crowd numbering thousands, all yelling, "No
justice, no peace," and, "The enemy is profit." Two days later, I find myself in a seminar
room in the whitewashed halls of Kohlberg, deliberating the virtues of free trade and the
complexities of the international economics. I like trying to resolve contradictions as much
as the next person. Is it really the same thing that leads some of us to pontificate in the economics department while others take to the streets and get arrested in opposition? The obvious answer is: Yes, of course. It's a simple case of the economists vs. the activists, Paul
Krugman vs. John Sweeney. At Swarthmore, unfortunately, reality is never that simple.
What is discussed in academic departments and activist clusters is the phenomenon of
globalization, where global trade and capital flows have exponentially increased in the
last decades, bringing unprecedented wealth to some and leaving others behind. In principle, completely free trade is a Utopia: If everyone produces what they are most productive at producing and shares it, then there will be by definition more for everyone.

push people onto tl
streets of Seattle, Ne
York, Brussels, Pragu
and Istanbul. The objection is not so much in th
essence of the process, which follows the fairly sim
pie and inexorable logic of capital hitting on othei
capital trying to spawn yet more capital, and
which is harder to completely suppress than the
natural urges and appetites of any of us.
The problem arises from the structure and
facilitation of the process, which is after all a political project.
Less than a thousand of the wealthiest individuals in the world came together and effectively re-established their own rules for their own pet capital, rules
that could supercede rules made by millions and billions of their fellow human
beings. The structures, or lack of them, that exist act to serve the interests of
the rich boys' club, those millionairesand billionaires in on the game and blocking entry for others. And this leads to a question that, I hope, will bring the departments
and the streets together: Do we need trust in the self-interest of the power-hungry to
improve global welfare? I believe even the economists would answer that question negatively, though qualified as most things in economics are.
A force as powerful as globalization should be constructively channeled to maximize
global utility, just as a raging river needs to be channeled so as to provide productive energy and not to flood villages on the way. Economics tends to remain value-neutral on such
things but can also be harnessed to great use. In telling us what the costs are, it can show

us how to do it more intelligently.
This is why I don't have much sympathy for those who think that protesting at global
conferences is sufficient as a movement for global economic justice. The protests serve a
vital function: to affirm that another world is possible. But what world? What should this
other world look like? How do we get from here to there? You can almost hear the economists ask the activists this. These questions shouldn't be paralyzing but, rather, inspiring:
We get to put our God-given imagination, intelligence and wisdom to good use and build a
harness for globalization that satisfies both economists' cynicism and the desire for real
in all of our hearts. How's that for some good work?

justice

Needless to say, I did not attend the World Economic Forum protests last weekend. I presume I was not missed amidst the ludicrous smorgasbord of Communists, anarchists, femi-

nists, animal rights extremists, anti-Israeli zealots and postmodern drug-addicted quacks
that make up contemporary leftist protests. Thankfully, there were no destructive riots this
time, unlike in Prague, Genoa and Seattle. Yet even without violence, these übiquitous
protests do have deleterious effects and therefore must be addressed. For example, former
President Clinton conveniently declared that the body politic's support of free trade was
shattered after Seattle in order to help move Al Gore to the left for the upcoming primaries.
I cannot adequately espouse the complexities of the issues the protesters raise in this limited space. This does not seem to bother those protesters who make up meaningless threeword bromides like, "energy plan, energy scam!" and chant them over and over again at earpiercing volumes to the irritation of all. But I will try and touch on the overarching issue of
globalization that seems to unite the leftist backlash. They tend to make four primary arguments against globalization: 1) trade is bad; 2) multinationals are bad; 3) the IMF, WTO and
World Bank are bad; and 4) more labor and environmental standards are needed.
International trade is profoundly good for both developing
and developed countries. The only nations to have successfully developed in the last 50 years have done so through export
promotion. The reason for this is that massive international
markets allow countries to focus on what they do best. The protesters' "try and do it alone" autarkic advice smells like
Maoism and, if implemented, would effectively eliminate poor
nations' hopes of ever becoming wealthy. Developed countries
benefit from trade because logic dictates that dispersed consumers benefit far more from cheaper imports than
rent-seeking producers do from maintaining artificially high prices. For example, every sugar job

$500,000.

Similarly, multinational corporations help

false, no nation would want them and no worker
would choose to work for them. The way Third

DAVID ELLIS
Big Man on Campus

World nations have gotten richer over the past
fifty years is by moving from agriculture to
textile factories and then onward to less commodified industries as their
wages increase. Multinationals also help establish factories and teach
management and organization skills to Third World individuals.
Likewise, the World Trade Organization is highly beneficial for all
its members. Restrictions to trade are always second best solutions to
other remedies such as subsidies. The IMF provides short-term loans
to nations in desperate straits. There has been some debate about
whether they misdiagnosed the Asian crisis as a traditional balance of
M
payments problem when it really was a liquidity crisis, but this is far
above the protesters' heads. The World Bank has been at the forefront
of worldwide economic development for the past 50 years. The intelligent messages the protesters have to offer (and they are few and far
between), such as Third World debt relief, originated within the World
Bank itself. Third World nations are attractive to multinationals because they offer workers
willing to work for low wages.
The reason these workers make low wages is that, on balance, they are less productive
than their developed nation counterparts. Imposing First World labor standards in the Third
World simply makes their labor more expensive and less attractive to multinationals. This
suits the developed world union protesters just fine, thank you. Environmental standards
have a similar effect, and pretentiously presuppose that elite environmentalists know better
than individual nations how their countries should operate.
This was hardly an adequate exposition on the benefits of globalization, but I sincerely
doubt that a majority of Davos protesters could give an intelligent response. At these
protests, volume is valued more than sophisticated argumentation. The act of modern
protesting precludes rational discourse, informs little and annoys many. The protesters
wreak destruction upon city after city so that a bunch of predominantly wealthy and white
kids can seek companionship, self worth, stories, nostalgia and a desperate need to pretend
they are as important as their more noble counterparts in the 19605. I am sickened that some
of my colleagues at Swarthmore attended this travesty, and I am disgusted by their pathetic
attempts at puerile exhibitionism at the expense of the world's poor.

Joey Spadola's romp with
the rambunctious at
Philadelphia's premier
automobile event

MONSTER TRUCK JAM 2002
BY JOEY SPADOLA

jspadoll@swarthmore.edu

It was the urgent counsel of Socrates that the speculations of man should above all be concerned not with the
exterior or the physical world, but rather with the human
soul
with that which transpires, from the peculiar vantage of our species, within. On this point, the teachings of
St. Augustine, not less than those of Rousseau or Dr.
Johnson, have redounded to the Athenian's praise. And it
is not an exaggeration to say that, before the modern era,
few thinkers in the Western world, save the occasional
men of science, bothered themselves with aught but the

palpitations of the human heart and the flights of the
human spirit.
In this philosophic folly I myself had always persisted.
This past weekend, however, I was finally shook, as from a
pleasant but baseless daydream, from the crude belief in
the priority of human sentiments over the heedless power
of lifeless matter.
I cannot just now remember whether it was the terrible
leap
accomplished in 2.6 seconds, across the combined
breadth of four stationary cars
on the part of the Grave
Digger; or rather the terrific and ruthless destruction,
authored by the Big Dang, of no less than six vehicles in no
more than the tenth part of a minute,
I cannot remember which of these, I say, first effected in me the realization

that, whatever it is that we the sons and daughters of
Adam harbor within our breast, it is of little consequence
next to that raw, awesome force which can sometimes be
found to operate outside of, and indifferent to, our fragile
human clay.
It was, in any case, at the Monster Truck Jam 2002,
which took place Saturday at the First Union Spectrum in
Philadelphia, that this realization was impressed upon me.
Now, I am not of a daring turn, and fear and unfamiliarity will usually keep me from such events. But on this
occasion curiosity compelled me to attend in their spite,
though I could scarcely anticipate the change which would
THE PHOENIX

be wrought upon my character.
Upon arrival, I had the privilege to be conducted to the
press box, and from this I commanded a view of such proximity to the arena as to inspire not less terror than awe. I
could see with clarity the tire tracks upon the dirt and the
mud splattered against the low arena walls. To the danger
which might impend from such a position, in so violent an
exhibition, I became fully alive. Indeed, I am nervous by
constitution; and I could maintain some control over my
composure only by satisfying myself that, at nearly the
same distance, there were seated no fewer than a thousand
10-year-old boys who, for their part, seemed more delight-

ed than otherwise.

I seated myself, and bent my regard upon the
main attraction of the affair, viz. the trucks, which,
though still stationary, were nonetheless formidable to
the view. They appeared to be of some 25 feet in every
dimension, save the width, in which, for agility, the figure
was slightly smaller; two elephants lined up lengthwise
would give a very tolerable notion of their immensity. In
weight, however, they exceeded that animal in the proportion of five or six to one, at times approaching 12,000
pounds. There was moreover a certain formidability
about the general design of the vehicles which put me in
mind of that famous refrain of Blake who, had he seen a
monster truck, would have been little awed by the tiger:
What immortal hand or eye/Dared frame thy fearful symmetry.
Scarcely had I accustomed my senses to the surroundings when the order was given for the drivers to start
their engines. From these latter issued forth a noise so
dreadful and so thunderous that I nearly fell from my
chair. It struck upon my nerves like a death knell. I immediately had recourse to the earplugs with which I was supplied. And even so my auditory faculty found little peace.
The events immediately commenced. The first was a
kind of leaping competition, in which the trucks had to
launch themselves from a ramp and clear a distance of
several lined-up stationary cars in the least time possible.

It was not long before a record was set. Allen Pezo, upon
the Predator, jumped five vehicles in under 2.5 seconds, a
feat which, as I understand it, had never before been
accomplished. Mr. Pezo is now at full liberty to say with
Chateaubriand: J'ai fait l'histoire I have made history.
There then began a race of "pro-quads" around the circumference of the track. The smallness of these vehicles
eased my soul in some measure, and the noise which they
produced was, happily, much less formidable. But the multitude was no less worked up. It seemed that every spectator had a favorite driver toward whom he boisterously
directed his applause and approbation.
"Smoke the fuck out of 'em, Bobby," cried one.
"Make those goddamn pansies eat dirt, Frank," added
another.
"Rock their shit, Stan," bellowed a third.
"Well done, old man," added the present author (who
was not untouched by the general sentiment), provoking
thereby not a few looks of disgust.
Several other events followed, but I feel myself incapable of describing in words that of which steel and
chrome alone can give a just notion. The devastation of
The King Krunch
how can it be described? The feats of
The Black Stallion
who has ready at call expressions
adequate to their grandeur? I am unequal to the task, and
must leave all to the imagination of the reader.
At the end of the show, I met in the press box one of the
announcers, and with that illustrious fellow I had the privilege of being photographed. I also met, by another strike
of favorable fortune, the wives of two of the drivers. They,
however, declined to be photographed, and it is to be rued,
for they were not unphotogenic. I may repeat what
Vonnegut once said of writers' wives: "I have never once
met the wife of a monster-truck driver who was not beau-

tiful."

The engines gave one final roar before being quelled for
the night, and I quit the arena in contemplation not of my
soul but of iron suspensions and reinforced fiberglass. Not
Socrates' self could have done otherwise.

'Gosford Park' clean but slow
BY MORGHAN HOLT
mholtl@swarthmore.edu
On entering the already darkened Ritz Bourse theater,
my four-year-old daughter and I were acutely aware that
she was the only child at the movie. Granted, the show was
rated R, and most people have discretion enough to not
take their young children to "restricted" movies on the fundamental premise that, if it's "restricted," it contains material that's too much for innocent tots to handle. I don't
operate on that policy. If a movie's not nightmare-inducing
or unabashedly pornographic, it's O.K. in my book. And,
popcorn crunching and not-so-stifled whispers aside, she's
a pretty good movie buddy.
Despite the movie's "restricted" nature, I was surprised
that there weren't more young people in the audience. Next
to my little girl, I was the youngest one there. This made

me nervous.
I knew, sort of, what "Gosford Park" was supposed to be
about. That is to say, I had briefly scanned the Philadelphia
Weekly blurb, finally selecting it for its early showing and
seemingly harmless content. I knew it was set in Victorian
times. I knew it involved a mystery of some sort. Beyond
that, I was clueless. And I was intimidated by the fact that
my fellow viewers were well on their way to cashing in

their 401K plans and tsking unreservedly at my obviously
remiss decision to let my child tag along.
The movie started slowly, dully. I feared I'd fall asleep
and further offend my elders with my bored-stiff snoring. I
feared my daughter would pry my eyes open and loudly
cuss me out for taking her to a stupid movie.
We met the characters, who were, by and large, equally
unoriginal, stereotypical British Victorian characters: the
moneybags old geezer, sugar daddy for all members of his
extended family, and who, we later learn, has a particularly lecherous and rather repulsive inkling toward his
female help; his wife, young and blonde and frivolous in
her open flirtation with anyone boasting fewer than her
husband's sixty-plus years; a cast of sisters, daughters of
the geezer, all of whom are accompanied by their equally
useless, wimpy, greedy husbands; an old crotchety aunt,
whose dry wit and uppity humor I came to appreciate as,
really, the only non-stifling outlet in the first segment of
the film; and an American actor and his producer, who
would soon become amusing novelties and sources of
much swooning for their hosts.
And we met the servants. All of them. My head spun as
I tried to keep them straight: who's in the kitchen and
who's serving the table and who's hiding under the stairs
and how each was related to their upper-crust employers.
The "country house," as they called it, was huge and complicated in its architecture, and it was tough for me to
make sense of the scenery as everyone bustled around and
got settled in. The family and the Americans were gathering for a pheasant hunt
that much I caught. And the ser-

vants were having a field day badmouthing their collective
employers as they prepared the meals and pressed the
evening gowns

behind closed doors.
The whole first part of the movie, really, was a bunch of
introduction, a voyeuristic, inactive view of the snobbishness and general ignorance of the wealthy characters, juxtaposed with the secret lives, the whispered gossip, the
crass comments of their lower-class help. 0.K., I guess, if

staff and the tension mounts between his wife and all the
males present. The staff openly admits to hating him. His
sons-in-law are desperate for money, and the old aunt
wants a bigger slice of the pie. The American producer
reveals the murder-mystery-in-an-old-mansion-in-theEnglish-countryside plot of his upcoming film. And it
seems everyone has a motive. So when the old guy's offed,
it's not terribly shocking. The question is, whodunit? And
it seems everyone's a perfectly valid suspect.
"Gosford Park" got interesting at the end, when things
were finally built up enough to become intricate and mysterious. By then, it was almost as enticing and complex to
walk through the possible perpetrators and the possible
means and motives as it is to follow Hercule Poirot on one
of his many intriguing missions. Only the detective was
hardly Poirot caliber, and the mystery went unsolved, disclosed only by the brief, overlapping interludes that regularly allowed the audience to peek into the private lives of
the characters.
Full of astonishing surprises and unexpected twists at
the end, and managing to tie things cleanly together as a
good mystery should, "Gosford Park" is a worthwhile show
if you don't mind sitting through an hour's worth of soap
opera.

House music: a

primer

Our resident music geek recounts his history with the genre
BY ROSS HOFFMAN
khoffmal@swarthmore.edu
My love affair with house music began around
New Year's Eve of 1999 while cruising down the parkways of suburban Connecticut. A friend of the girlfriend I was visiting at the time popped a copy of
"Remedy" by Basement Jaxx in the car stereo, thereby changing my entire perspective on music.
Although I had dabbled in techno for a year or so, this
was the first thing I'd heard that managed to be simultaneously outrageously funky, undeniably musical,
unconscionably silly, utilizing all of the genre's

strengths and avoiding its pitfalls of monotony and
predictability. And then there was "Red Alert," with
the most arresting bass line ever, which still sounds
fresh to me even though it's been played at every
party I've attended ever since. That first brush with
the Jaxx set me off on a quest to explore what other
hedonistic pleasures I might have been missing out
on in the world ofhouse.
In essence, as far as I can tell (and electronica is
not known for the clarity of its genre divisions), house
music is the extension of disco into the 90s. Its crucial
element is a driving four-on-the-floor disco beat,
which is often extensively layered with filtered highhats, funky breaks and similar embellishments.
Unlike more subtle forms such as ambient and jungle,
house exists for one reason: to get the party started.
This is dance music without pretensions, and that
unashamed single-mindedness of purpose is for me a
large part of its appeal. It's not for everyone: like

disco in the 70s, the genre has more than its share of
detractors, who decry it as mindless, simplistic,
monotonous, etc. Much of it is, of course; probably the
vast majority is. I've never been very impressed, for
instance, with most American house musicians, even
though purists will be quick to remind me that the
genre started here, in the gay club scene of Detroit in
the 80s.
For whatever reason, electronic music is truly a

global phenomenon. House practitioners range from
Japanese cheeseball Plastic Fantastic Machine to the
endlessly inventive Dutch duo Arling & Cameron.
The most impressive body of work comes from the
French, who in the second half of the 90s revived the
marriage of gloriously mindless funk and uncompromising silliness. The range of French house artists
includes poster-children Daft Punk, who struck gold
with the spare bombastic funk of their 1997 debut
"Homework"; rock-infusers Rinocerose, who come up
with song titles like "la guitaristic house organisation" and "I love ma guitare"; funkmeisters Cassius,

whose anno-nymous album "1999" is an incredible

testament to the myriad uses of the four-on-the-floor
beat; and enfant terrible Dimitri from Paris, whose
first epitomized hopelessly French lounge-jazz on his
debut, "Sacrebleu," and then made the house-disco
connection more explicit than ever on his sublime
mix album "A Night at the Playboy Mansion."
Last year was a rather quiet for me and house
music, with nothing much of note except for two longawaited sophomore albums from already legendary
artists, both of which turned out to be somewhat
uneven, even mediocre. Both Basement Jaxx's
"Rooty" and Daft Punk's aptly titled "Discovery"

were notable primarily for their preponderance of
songs. Like, with lyrics. On the Basement Jaxx
release especially, nearly every track has not only a
prominent vocalist, but an honest-to-goodness versechorus-verse song structure, too. Sometimes it works,
but who really wants to be bothered with lyrical content when they're getting down? With anything more
complicated than exhortations to dance, or reminders
"the music keeps on playing on and on," it's probably
just as well to stay away.

Lis Harvey to play Swarthmore for V-Day
and wears combat boots and listens to Bitch and Animal.

BY KATE DUFFY
kduffyl@swarthmore.edu

Lis Harvey has been compared to Alanis Morrisette and Ani DiFranco in countless
press releases and entertainment blurbs. But she sees herself as a distinct sort ofacoustic
folk singer: "I set myself apart by not writing all of these songs that start out with 'I feel
so alone' and all that crap," says Harvey. "I do my own thing. That's the similarity
between me and Ani. It's not that I sound like her or that I play my instrument like her,
though she's a god when it comes to being a musician. She chooses to make her own way
her own choices. And that's what I do."
Harvey, a 25-year-old guitar player, will play at Swarthmore's
Intercultural Center on Tuesday as a part of the college's V-Day
Week campaign. She has been active for many years on the feminist front through events like Will Folk For Food, a series of benefit concerts to raise money for battered women's shelters, and
operating a completely female-run, independent record label.
Next fall she will tackle a tour of all 50 states in only two months.
While Harvey's feminist leanings may be the reason for a
dearth of mainstream success, she shrugs it off: "I'm not interested in a record label giving me money. I'm too protective of my
own fragile muse."

Kate Duffy: When did you get involved with the feminist folk
movement?
Lis Harvey: There was a run-down womens' center at my colCourtesyLis Harvey
lege, sitting there unused because the last group of seniors was a
bunch of obnoxious, loud-mouthed lesbians. No one wanted to be associated with it. I saw
this as a problem, so I got involved with the refurbishing.
Feminism became a part of my music when it became a part of me. Just by virtue of
being involved with the center, I spent 12 hours every day thinking about feminism and
how everyone thinks it's a dirty word. It's such a simple thing: It's the belief that women
are equal to men. People should be ashamed to admit to not being feminists, given that
definition. It's not like it means somebody that totes around a ratchet and beats on men

THE PHOENIX

KD: What do you make of the mainstream success of women like Jewel?
LH: I don't have a problem with Jewel. There's room for everybody. The reason why you
see only beautiful women playing music is the institution that pushes them out front. At
the core of that system is money, not art. When I think about Jewel, Dido and the Indigo
Girls I feel sorry for them and I admire them. Jewel creates this stuff even though every-

body around her is only interested in money. "You wrote a nice song, and we're happy,
but is it going to be a hit? Is it going to make $40,000 every time it's aired on MTV?" That's
incredible pressure. It's something I would never want anything to do with. I'm surprised
people like Jewel can continue creating art instead of dying of sorrow.

KD: As a female musician, have you experienced any gender-based discrimination yourself from promoters or the media?
LH: Countless times. I'll call a promoter and say, "I'm coming through on Friday, and I'd
like to have a show. Any openings?" A male promoter will say, "Well, you know, Martin
Sexton's going to be there, so it might not be appropriate. But we're having a Girls Night
Out with local women songwriters on Tuesday." My voice and my art don't come across
to some men as music. To them, it's female music. But gender is not a genre. Period.
It doesn't matter what genre she plays; every female musician gets "You actually play
that thing?" It's insulting and annoying. It's so weird to be looked at as a novelty. I could
hold my own with Bob Dylan. It shouldn't matter that I'm a female. Men think we aren't
full time. I'm really defensive because I'm so proud of what I do.
KD: How have things for feminism and folk music changed since the days of Joni

Mitchell?

LH: Every time I choose to write "feminist musician" in a press release, I'm taking a huge
risk; somebody reads that and they think, "Oh, we don't want any part." Back in the 60s,
it wasn't a clandestine effort. I'm not some screaming, bra-burning maniac. Tell a venue
owner you're a feminist, and you can almost hear their little mind thinking, "And all she's
going to talk about is hating men." In this day and age you are pigeonholed. In the 60s,
women were still making that pigeonhole. They were ground-breaking, and it was hard in
different ways.

Students want diverse

Protesters describe jail conditions

From PROTESTS, pg. 3

From ADMISSIONS, pg. 4
Lourdes Carrasco 'O4 said. "We just need to show them lots of energy."
She cited personal phone calls and letters of congratulations from
HOLA as important ways to give admitted students a connection with
Swarthmore.
The total minority percentage at Swarthmore is just under 35 percent, not including international students.
SASS includes in its goals "getting black students from different
backgrounds," Dorelien said, adding that admissions tries to recruit at
high schools with students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds
than the average Swarthmore student.
As a student in the Boston public school system, however, Laurel
Kean 'O3 has observed the opposite. She attended a public school,
Boston Latin, where minimal guidance forced students and their parents to take the college application process into their own hands.
Swarthmore did not recruit at any Boston public schools in her senior
year, Kean said, though it did visit private and suburban schools. After
she spoke with admissions personnel at Swarthmore and her high school,
a Swarthmore recruiter visited Boston Latin. But the rest of the Boston
public school system has yet to host a Swarthmore admissions officer.
Judging from her experience, Kean believes that "if Swarthmore
was truly committed to social justice, they'd be accepting and aggressively recruiting more disenfranchised people." But she acknowledged
that financial aid, as well as "the issue of preparation, to say nothing of
intellectual prowess," make it a challenge to recruit at a high schools
that lack a structure geared toward sending students to college.
Bock said admissions seeks students from "all walks of life," including students whose parents did not attend college or those who went to
schools that do not usually send students to colleges like Swarthmore.
Although the admissions office has always recruited at schools with
high minority populations, he added, this year it also targeted schools
with minorities who were "interested in and capable of thriving at
Swarthmore," whether the schools had high minority populations or
not. These schools include some that have historically lacked strong
minority populations.

SPAC co-coordinator Matt Armstrong 'O5 said, 'and
it also was about the war on terrorism. Because the
forum was talking about how businesses were going
to respond to terrorism, a lot of the groups that came
were protesting against the loss of civil liberties and
the bombing ofcivilians in the war on terrorism."
The protests on Sunday, however, were of an
entirely different nature. According to SPAC member Micah White 'O4, Sunday's protests were meant
to be more audible. The general feeling on Saturday,
he explained, was that the protests had not received
much attention. On Sunday, those protesting wanted
to make a stronger statement against the forum.
Only seven of the protestors from Swarthmore
elected to remain in New York for Sunday's actions.
"Sunday's protests were unpermitted events," White
said. "Everyone met on St. Mark's Place and started
beating drums. We formed a group and tried to create a visible dissent."
According to The New York Times, police officers
followed close behind the group as it marched
throughout the East Village. The Times reported
that a police officer was quoted as saying, "Give
them a chance to violate the law."
When a few protestors violated city traffic laws,
the police moved in and made arrests.
Juliet Lashinsky-Revene 'O4 narrowly avoided
arrest as she ran through the streets of Lower
Manhattan on Sunday. "We were weaving in and out
of cars and all of sudden they started grabbing people and we started to run," she said. "One police officer grabbed me and I just wrenched free and ran."
When Colman, Holt and O'Brien were taken into
custody, they were placed in "plasti-cuffs" and taken
to jails in Brooklyn.

The students who were arrested believe that the
were violating the protesters' civil rights.
"The arrests were perfect examples of what we had

police

been protesting," said Colman. "We knew that they
were looking for people to arrest, and this clearly
explains why we were arrested even though we had

not done anything illegal."
O'Brien explained that the police never warned
to the protesters to disperse and that he did not have
his Miranda Rights read to him upon his arrest.
Additionally, some of those arrested were held in jail
for almost 20 hours over the maximum 36 hours
allowed by New York state law. He believes that he
has enough material to initiate a class action lawsuit
against the New York City Police Department over

its conduct this past weekend.
According to Holt, the prisoners were not treated
civilly by the police officers. Holt was in plasti-cuffs
for over seven hours. "After all of the time in the
cuffs, I had lost circulation and mobility in my right
arm. My hand was numb up to my elbow," he said.
All three of those held in jail recounted stories of
police officers' mistreatment of the prisoners. The
prisoners were denied access to full meals, and
O'Brien said most of the male prisoners were interrogated. "They held us because they wanted to paint
the protesting group as a terrorist group," O'Brien
said. "They kept searching us looking for damaging
information or evidence that just did not exist."
Officials dispute the accounts of those held prisoners. According to reports published in the Times,
the police officers followed normal procedure. They
issued an audible warning telling the crowds that "it
was time to leave." Police commissioner Raymond
W. Kelly was quoted in Tuesday's Times as believing
that the police officers had maintained the peace to
the best of their abilities.
After being in jail for almost two and a half days,
the three Swarthmore students did not have kind
words for the NYPD. None of the students were
pleased with the way they had been treated in jail or
with processing time. "We weren't people to them,"
said Holt. "They didn't want to treat us like people."

College makes 50-year projections for land use

within a year, he siad, but would
have no immediate impact on how
the land would be used.
The college owns over 300 acres
of land, about half of it on the far
side of the Crum. While Schall said

he "wouldn't say the college is running out of land," most of the academic space on campus already
heavily built up. Since the extensive green space on campus is on of
the college's unique features, it
means there are few good locations
left for additional buildings.

The college will present longterm proposals to the borough
council on Feb. 20. Yesterday,
Schall gave a presentation to faculty in which he outlined the principles the college intends to guide its
land use policy. A similar presentation will be made to students.

Activists dramatized concerns despite agreement
From ACTIVISM, pg. 4
college, an activist sub-group ofSASS is in the works,
executive board member Elizabeth Lindsey 'O2 said.
According to longtime members of the college,
the "direct actions" SASS took in 1969 were a function of a national movement, but the level of accessibility students have to their administrators is part
of a longstanding trend, not something new.
Anthropology professor Stephen Piker, who has
been at the college since 1966, remembered "a lot of
agreement" in terms of what students wanted from

the administration and what the administration
wanted to give. "The differences [in goals] in part
had to do with how rapidly they wanted the changes
to occur and how strident they were," he said. It has
been in "the nature of Swarthmore" to listen to its
students for as long as he has been here.
Referring to the college president's sudden death
during the sit-in, Stott said it was not SASS's
requests but their strong language and demands that
made it "reasonable to expect that the circumstances
of 'direct action' may have contributed to the strain.
"We didn't like the language of 'sit-in' and 'nonnegotiable demands,' he said.
Maurice Eldridge '6l, vice president of college
and community relations, explained that "students
had a need to place a forceful front against what they
saw as the resistance
they understood that what
they wanted was wanted by the administration" but
also needed to show unity and dramatize the issues.
"

...

THEPHOENfX

"At the same time," he said, "they knew they were
dealing with people who were listening to them."
Compared to other campuses, Stott said,

Swarthmore was non-violent. He remembered seeing pictures of armed students making demands
from their administrators at other campuses.
Eldridge said students elsewhere felt themselves "in
a much less giving and much more hostile environ-

ment."

Piker pointed out that, although the SASS members
of 1969 "sometimes did disruptive things," they were
"exceedingly well-behaved when they were in [the
admissions office]... they left the place immaculate."
Eldridge said that, since 1969, there has developed
a "meeting of the minds between what the students
want and what the faculty want to support." As time
progressed following the sit-ins, there was a broad
growth in the college's responsiveness to students'
needs and a resulting growth in student services.
"The more they were heard, the more they wanted
to be heard," Eldridge said. This has led to such institutions as the Black Cultural Center, the
Intercultural Center, student observers at Board of
Managers meetings and the hiring of a dean of multicultural affairs.
Eldridge also commented on the protests and discussions SASS organized last spring in response to
what they perceived as racially motivated treatment
from the Swarthmore Police Department. "They had
campus support, they had administrative support,"

Erik Munroe 'O4

I believe that what Student Council needs is a new face that
would add a new approach. I am running for Secretary of
Student Council because, as a member of the student body, I
want to ensure that the concerns and opinions of all students
are heard and addressed.
It would be my responsibility to keep minutes of the meeting.
I would like to make these minutes more accessible to the student body. Perhaps posting them on the Daily Jolt or on the
Student Council board in Parrish would be the best solution.
I would make a concerted effort to work closely with committees
such as SAC and the Parking Committee in order to
more accurately represent the student body.
The Secretary is fiscally responsible for SC and works with the
Student Budget Committee. I would voice my concerns about
allocating funds so that all groups and committees receive a
fair distribution of finances. I believe issues directly associated
with the students are those that the members of student council can and should make a substantial contribution toward.

The roles that the Secretary must fill involve councilstudent body relations, the keeping of the council budget,
as well as more mundane details such as taking minutes.
Student involvement with Student Council is mainly
limited to voting for members, and once this is done, participation is limited. I believe the student body should
have more of a presence in Student Council, so that their
ideas and goals can be fought for. The council members
can come up with some good ideas, but including the
1400 other minds would be better.
I would work to increase student involvement by keeping
you better informed by posting minutes to a Web site and emailing them to people who want them and by being constantly available to discuss ideas. I would also work toward
other goals such as the SEPTA discount. I believe these
ideas, along with my previous experience in similar groups,
such as my high school student government, in which I was
Vice President, make me the best person for the job.

I would love to serve the Swarthmore campus as the next
Secretary of Student Council. I feel that I am uniquely qualified for this position due to my previous experience on
Student Council as the Campus Relations Representative, my
current position on Student Budget Committee and my experience on the Orientation Committee. If elected, I have a host
of initiatives that I will work to implement. First and foremost,
the escalating prices and deteriorating food quality of Tarble
must be reformed. Second, the lack of secure storage on this
campus is a perennial problem that needs to be fixed. Finally,
everyday annoyances like dorms still waiting for a printer will
be addressed. I love Swarthmore, and I would love the opportunity to make life here more hassle-free for the student body.

I am a Swarthmore student and an athlete. As such I have
often found it difficult to enjoy the full range of lectures and
activities offered here. Even if I were not an athlete I would
sometimes be unable to attend two overlapping events. As secretary, I intend to enhance students' ability to participate in
events that they are not able to attend. I want to create a
newsletter that outlines the events of a fireside chat or lecture.
In order to avoid bombarding students with reserved-students e-mails, the newsletter would be sent to those who subscribed at the beginning of each semester. It would also be
accessible online. I intend to set up a system that allows lectures to be recorded. Concerts are constantly recorded, lectures should be as well. Students would have the opportunity to
immediately access any event they were unable to attend, or
access it in the future as research resource.

Hi, everyone! I would love to represent you as SC
Secretary/Treasurer. My platform is about realizing goals:
Let's use our resources! Without having an all-campus revolution, here are a few ideas that would make life at Swat

"Maturity is the ability to make a decision and stand by it.
The immature spend their lives exploring endless possibilities and then do nothing. Maturity means dependability,
keeping one's word and coming through in a crisis. The
immature are masters of the alibi." So wrote my grandmother in an article she sent me just after I returned to school.
With this in mind, I'd only like to add two items to my former platform: 1) reforming Swatmail, and 2) ensuring that

Computers: What about a second computer in Kohlberg coffee bar? Also, have you ever wanted to check your e-mail
while in Parrish? We are supposed to have a computer lab in
Trotter. Have you ever seen it open at night? Me neither.
Food: Sharpies should at least be open until 7:30 p.m. every
day. What about bag lunches on Monday and Friday as well?
Mail room: It should be open on Saturday, from 11 a.m. to 2
p.m. Students should not have to wait until Monday to get a
package or express mail. This should not be a difficult task.
These are just a few ideas I will fight for. I'm opting to
attain tangible results while working on larger topics like
financial aid for Swatties with parents who refuse to pay.
Last year I served as secretary of the International Club;
currently, I serve on SAC and the Admissions Committee. I'm
available at extension 5621 if you have any questions.

small campus activist groups maintain their autonomy
rather than be grouped together for purposes of funding.
Also, I stand behind lockers in Parrish for Mary Lyon residents, getting a karaoke machine for the school, and
installing new copiers in dormitories if at all feasible, as well
as keeping students informed about psychological services
available on campus.

Bullets sink Tide
Briones and Whitehead hope to spur squad
at the Centennial Conference Championships
BY KATHRYN JANTZ
kjantzl@swarthmore.edu
Nineteen hundredths of a second, the

equivalent of a slipped turn and a poorly
timed breath, determined the outcome of
the men's swim meet against Gettysburg.
The men lost by a score of 112 to 93, and the
Swarthmore women lost by a score of 115 to
90. Both Swarthmore teams put up a fight
with an astounding 47 season best times.
Beating the Garnet Tide was no easy
task for the Gettysburg Bullets. According
to head coach Sue Davis, it took the Bullets
63 season best times (not including tapered
times) to win and even then, they won by
the narrowest of margins. Davis told the
team, "I couldn't have expected more from
you or been more proud. You guys swam
the best dual meet we have ever had
against Gettysburg."
According to tri-captain Allison Lyons
'O2, "The team put up a really good fight.
The men's team was the closest they have
ever come to beating Gettysburg, but they
have a really strong and deep team."
Although Gettysburg remains the winner' of the regular seasoon dual meets,
Swarthmore made a significant improve-

ment from last year's slaughter.
At Saturday's meet, David Whitehead
'O3 and Natalie Briones 'O3, two of
Swarthmore's top swimmers, got a taste of
the competition they will face at the
Centennial Conference Championships.

Briones, who had spent the season unde-

feated, ran up against tough competition
from the Gettysburg women in the 100-yard
freestyle and 200-yard individual medley.
She placed second in both events, an
unusual occurrence for an athlete who
more often than not finishes first.
Briones has always been a strong asset
to the team. According to Amy Auerbach
'O2, "Natalie's versatility and enthusiasm
has proved invaluable throughout her
career here."
During her first year at Swarthmore*
Briones qualified for NCAA Division 111
Nationals in the 200-yard and 100-yard
breaststroke. In the midst of what could be
considered the best season of her college
career, Briones is looking forward to
another shot at nationals. Along with buying presents for her "psych sisters,"
Briones is getting psyched for her third
trip to conferences. She is currently seeded
second in the conference in her two best

events.
Whitehead, a member of Trinidad's
national swim team, is also gearing up for
conferences. He even has a bottle of garnetcolored hair dye ready for the occasion. For

the second week in a

row,

Whitehead

proved his superior athleticism, this time
in the final event against Gettysburg. He
swam a 47.5 in the 400-yard free relay
pulling the margin

between second and

first from three or four seconds to nine
hundredths of a second.
"David has been stepping up for
freestyle events," Mike Dudley 'O3 said.

Claire Weiss Phoenix Staff

The outcome of the dual meet with Gettysburg was not determined until the finish of
the final event. The Bullets broke the Tide's unbeaten streak with a 115-90 victory.
"We have really needed him." Last year, he
made the "B" nationals cut in the 200 yards
butterfly. If one makes the "A" cut, one
automatically qualifies for nationals. If one
only makes the "B" cut, one may or may
not be accepted into the meet; only a certain number of swimmers who only make
the "B" cut are allowed.
This season, Whitehead, like Briones,
finds himself performing better than he did
last year. He says his weaker sophomore
season was due to the unexplainable phenomenon of the "sophomore slump."
Currently, Whitehead is only one second
off of the "B" cut in the 50-yard freestyle,

two seconds in the 100-yard butterfly and

four seconds in the 200-yard butterfly.
Briones and Whitehead, along with the
rest of the team, are excited for the final
two meets of the season and its climax.
"We are looking forward to our next two
meets because it will be some of our hardest competition," Auerbach said. "If we
beat Washington, we will be in a three way
tie for first in a dual meet season with
Gettysburg and Washington."
Davis told the team, "Dickinson's team
looks like us so it will be definitely a close
meet. The team that wants it the most will
be the victors."

Many athletes rue the extended bus ride almost as
much as the postgame ice-cold trickle showers, steamy
gymnasiums and gnarly pregame sexual favors for the officials that accompany the away game experience. By adhering to a few straightforward guidelines, however, the experience can be significantly less painful. Here is the compilation of a few caveats for those eternal Centennial

Conference bus tours. Transit phenomena to avoid:

The Commode Forcefield: A three-seatradius must be

established in the area immediately to the front and side of
the toilet vicinity. Should the bus be slightly overcrowded
and a player is forced to break the three-seat force field,
that player will adopt the strawberry-urine-8.0.-cigarettecrotch aroma permanently emanating from said toilet
region. This fragrance is rumored to endure until the

encroaching player's next shower in disinfectant and/or
expensive exfoliating bath bead product.
The Fiber Explosion: In attempt to quell the pregame
butterflies or the postgame tapeworm, many players score
nourishment from handy, pre-packaged snack foods. Dodge
any offers from teammates consisting of legumes, dried
fruits, popcorn or those sweetened bran squares often found
at the cereal bar. A few handfuls of any of the aforementioned tasty treats and you could be straddling the ceramic
recliner calling upon the gods of Pennsylvania Highway
Maintenance for assistance for many a pothole to come.
The Pack Mule: To avoid potential head injuries, black
eyes and ankle sprains, steer clear of the teammate donning excessive baggage. The contents of the overhead compartment always shift during the flight! Beware of flying
objects such as psychology textbooks, dirty laundry bags,

18

Gatorade jugs and Sharpies produce. On some winding
roads of Centennial Conference travel routes, baked goods
in Tupperware, in flight, are considered attempted assault
with a deadly weapon.
The Amateur Photographer: Although it is important to establish a cordial relationship with the team bus
driver, do not tread the oh-so-murky "sure-you-can-vigorously-snap-pictures-of-me-while-I-am-throwing-aroundother-sweaty-women-and-keep-them-for-personal-use" line.
And you better not post them on the Internet, having airbrushed-out our uniforms! Enough said.
Spilling the Special Chinese Food Sauce on Your
Travel Gear: En route eating options are few and far
between and often appear in trios of grocery stores, pizza
places and shady Chinese joints. Interestingly enough, the
latter is always a fan favorite. Not a fan favorite: when the
lights go off on the bus and you are balancing mixed veggies on your lap, rice between your knees and a virtual
bucket of MSG (disguised as brown sauce) somewhere
within the vicinity. When the lights go off, all bets arealso
off. Luck has nothing to do with it, and the equipment managers, Ray and Dave, know who the balance masters are by
the lack of crotch stains on the new, expensive travel suits.
Discussing "Female Related Topics" Within Ear
Shot of Your Male Assistant Coach: "I have the worst
cramps ever!" or "What brand of the pill are you on?" really cease to fly in the face of a male member of an otherwise
all-female audience. Also to be avoided would be touchy
subjects which could potentially embarrass him if he were
to posses the attributes the team group-deems undesirable.
Subject areas to avoid: circumcision ("Do you prefer the
cut or uncut version?"), chest hair ("Gross!"), penis size
("It isn't the size of the boat, but it has the motion of the
ocean") and sexual duration ("One and done?").
Cell Phone Use: Yes, this is a wireless generation. So
February 7,

2002

why are teammates and coaches alike guilty of abusing this
technology by coochie-cooing with loved ones? Cell phones
are for emergency use and on-the-fly business deals, not for
romantic conversations in close proximity of people just
dying to make fun of you. So next time you get the inkling
to speed dial the BF, curb it, and direct your loquaciousness
toward the human beings seated all around you.
Farting: Yeah, uh, in an enclosed area such as a bus,
bogus smells are slow to dissipate. Mix a stanky fart with
sweaty foot smell, old Sharpies bagels and Chinese food cartons with just a little bit offood left, and you have a virtual
aromatic Molotov cocktail. So suck that gas back up inside
or venture to the back of the bus to release it in the Gladethick environment of the traveling Porta-John, which will
be sure to attack the stink with a handful of chemicals.
Screw Conversations: You know that your Swat calendar isn't properly calibrated when your teammates start
discussing the annual "Screw Your Roommate Dance" in
December. The damn thing isn't until March, but believe us,
by the time you pick out the cutest outfit and go to meet that
guy that you have been yearning to hook up with (made possible by your oh-so-subtle request for your friends to secure
him as your date), all of us have been talking about it for
many moons. We just wish these conversations would take
place closer to the actual date of the dance, rather than
before Christmas. Rest assured that if you are decently tall,
have good skin, brush your teeth and don't wear sweats
every day, you are probably already on our list.
Just in case you were wondering, things that are
approved bus-ride behavior include: Brainstorming
baby names for coach Shibles' kid (right now, we like
Wawa and Jamiroquai as possibilities), doing homework
(duh), bringing along a "chick flick" for the return trip, discussing Swat's Most Eligible Bachelors and complimenting Caitlin and Emily, of course.

Williams sets high mark
for himself, teammates
Akpan takes 55-meter dash, 400meter dash at Ursinus Invitational
BY MARK JANOFF
mjanoffl@swarthmore.edu
The men's and women's indoor track team traveled to Ursinus
last Saturday to compete against Centennial Conference rivals at
the Ursinus Invitational. Once again, sprinters Matt Williams 'O4
and Imo Akpan 'O2 led the way for the men's and women's teams

respectively.
Akpan finished first overall in the 55-meter dash and won the 400meter dash with a time of 57.4 seconds, more than three seconds
ahead of her closest competitor. Williams' time of 8.4 seconds in the
55-meter high hurdles is the eighth best Centennial Conference time
in that event this year.
According to Williams, meticulous preparation is largely responsible for his success. "There's a lot involved in my preparation,"
Williams said. "There's the physical aspect of stretching properly
and the mental aspect of imagining the race beforehand and knowing what I'm going to do at each point."
Williams also uses music to psych himself up. "I blast Outkast
five minutes before the race," he said. Besides notching an outstanding time in the high hurdles, Williams placed first in his 400meter dash heat with a time of 56JL seconds.
Williams is not merely an outstanding individual performer,
however. He is also a constant, visible presence at practices, encouraging his teammates to practice hard and to succeed. When runners
or coaches are off task, Williams gets the squad back on track. When
coaches demand a particularly intense drill, Williams reminds his
teammates not to push themselves over the edge and get injured.
"He's certainly a motivational leader on the team with the sprinters," said Jason Perini 'O5, who runs the 55-meter dash and the 200meter dash.
Williams is modest about his leadership role on the team.
"Because track is such an individual sport, and since I'm only a
sophomore, I can't be as much of a leader as I'd want to be," he said.
"I just try and encourage everyone, but I can only do that to a certain extent."
Williams is especially supportive and encouraging of the rookie
sprinters and runners on the squad. Williams said that Keith
Bentrup 'Ol and Marc Jeuland 'Ol were "pretty influential" in his
development and that he hopes to return the favor now that he's in
a position to do so. Specifically, he thinks Perini and Brendan
Moriarty 'O4, both new to the team this year, are quality sprinters
with significant potential.
Williams has already greatly influenced Perini. "When I was a
prospective student, Matt hosted me and really took the time to tell
me about the team and encourage me to come," Perini said. Perini
finished third in his 55-meter dash heat with a time of 7.0 seconds.
Moriarty finished a couple of seconds behind Williams in the 400meter dash.
Williams thinks that the team has a lot of potential in its young
runners and sprinters and that it "should do very well in a couple of
years." Asked why the team as a whole does not succeed as much as
individuals such as himself, Williams said, "I think sticking with it
at Swarthmore is difficult. People join the team, do well, and then
academics come into the picture." Williams added, "I came here for
academics, and the thought has crossed my mind to concentrate on
them completely. But I'm not sure what I'd do with myself if I didn't
have track to fall back on." The team wouldn't know what to do with

itself, either.

Garnet indoor track will travel to Franklin
Marshall this
Saturday to participate in its invitational tournament.

and uses quickness to his advantage."
On the defensive end, Letendre shut down the Eagles' leading
scorer Steve Melniczak, holding him to just four points on 2-of-7
shooting and lowering his season average to 16.4 points per game.
"This win is about as good as any we have had this season," Chris

Loeffler said.
With another win under its belt, the young team is looking forward to closing the season on a positive note. "We've been getting a
lot of confidence in these past couple of games," Lewis said. "Usually
people are looking for the season to end by now. This season, we see
it as a real opportunity to pick up some wins."

Garnet Tide pull out
overtime victory 84-76
David Pearce and Kyle Lewis sunk
three-pointers to tie the game at the
end of regulation and the first overtime
BY DERRICK WU

dwul@swarthmore.edu

As a senior, co-captain Kyle Lewis 'O2
says, the game begins to slow down, a
shooter's confidence builds, and the play
seems to come together. Fortunately for the
Garnet Tide, everything came together for
Lewis when it mattered.

After

falling

behind Philadelphia

Biblical University twice with the game on
the line, veteran guard David Pearce 'O3
and Lewis knocked down game-tying threepointers in the final seconds of regulation
and the first overtime period, respectively.
With a new lease on life, the Tide (5-16)
finally pulled away from the Crimson
Eagles (8-12) in the second overtime period
and came away with a hard fought 84-76
win Monday.
The Tide battled through 15 lead
changes, 50 minutes of play, and ties at the
end of regulation and the first overtime
period. With 14 three-pointers, including
five from Lewis, four from Matt Gustafson
'O5 and three from Pearce, and sharp inside
passing, the Tide countered the Eagle's
slashing offense and zone defense.
Despite an eight-game losing streak dating back to Jan. 16, the team came into the

game against PBU brimming with confidence. "Other than shooting the ball, we
have really played quite well against several of the top teams in our conference in the
last couple of weeks," head coach Lee

Wimberly said.
"Although we struggled a little, I think
we have played very well lately but haven't
gotten the breaks," guard Chris Loeffler 'O4

added.

Kyle Lewis follows through on a mid-range jumper Monday against Philadelphia Biblical
University. Lewis led the Tide with 23 points, including a game-tying three-pointer with
seven seconds left in the first overtime period.

Last Saturday, the Tide held their own
against Franklin & Marshall, ranked No. 21
in the nation by D3hoops.com. "We played
really well against a team that made the

Final Four last year," Lewis said.
Lewis, who was named Centennial
Conference Player of the Week on Nov. 19

by averaging 18.5 points per game at the
Equinox Classic, broke out of a season-long
slump by scoring a team-high 23 points and
draining 5-of-7 field goals from downtown.
"Kyle is a huge part of this team, and
whenever a teammate plays as well as he
did, the team gains a lot of momentum,"
Chris Loeffler said. "I think we all built off
of Kyle's great play and energy on
Monday."

Lewis hit all five three point attempts in
the second half and overtime periods,
including a game-tying shot with seven seconds left in the first overtime.
"Kyle shot the lights out during the
game," point guard Jacob Letendre 'O4 said.
Earlier in the second half, Pearce tied
the game at 59 apiece by hitting a huge
three pointer with just two seconds left in
regulation. "We finally hit the big shots
that we needed to pull out a victory,"
Letendre said.
"The kids needed to have a couple of
bounces go their way, and knock down a
couple of big shots, and they did so last
night," Wimberly said.
Despite the overwhelming dramatics of
Lewis and Pearce, solid play from the
entire team contributed to the win. "It was
a real team win, with Dave and Kyle really
stepping up and refusing to lose," Letendre
said.
Gustafson, who has been consistent all
year, finished the game with 20 points. The
freshman forward helped put the game
away in the decisive second overtime period by connecting on both of his free throw
attempts and knocking in a huge threepointer to give the Tide a four-point lead
with 1:19 to play. "Matt Gustafson has shot
the ball consistently well," Wimberly said.
Fellow freshman Bayne Heersink 'O5
chipped in with 10 points and eight
rebounds. "Bayne's really big for us," said

Lewis. "He's a

Garnet badminton squad to a 4-1 victory against Albright. Lange
defeated Albright's Nicole Huber 1-11, 11-6, 11-5, at first singles to
lead the Garnet to a sweep of the singles matches. The Garnet
also participated in the PAIAW tournament Feb. 2 at Bryn Athyn.
Lange advanced to the semifinals, and teammate Surbhi Gupta
advanced to the finals only to fall there. Doubles team Liz
Leininger and Wury Morris took second in the doubles bracket. The
team captured second place overall. With the win over Albright,
Swarthmore's record advanced to 3-0, good for a lead in the
PAIAW. This coming week, the Garnet will embark on a three-game
road tour, facing Bryn Mawr Thursday, Bryn Athyn Tuesday and
Haverford Wednesday.
