# History

From the TriCo Digital Collections Website: 

“The Association for the Care of Colored Orphans, also known as “The Shelter,” was founded in Philadelphia by Quaker women in 1822 to care for black orphans, both boys and girls, within a nurturing, home-like environment. In 1915, it relocated to Cheyney, Pa, adjoining the property of Cheyney Training School for Teachers (now Cheyney University) and became a home for girls, known variously as the Shelter for Colored Orphans and the Shelter for Colored Children. In 1965, its name was changed to “Friends Shelter for Girls,” and its mission evolved to serve as a home for teenage girls, offering training and psychological support. It continued operation until 1981 when it ceased to function as a group home. It was succeeded by the Friends Association for the Care and Protection of Children which functioned as an emergency shelter.”

## About the Spreadsheets

The spreadsheets here list the childrens' names, recorded ages, birthdays when available, assumed gender, admission date, parent/guardian names when available,  witnesses to the signing, and the signatory’s mode of signing the document. Before literacy was widespread in the United States, people who could not read or write signed documents with an “X” in place of their name; thus, recording how the signatory signed the document can provide useful information about literacy among free black Americans in the Philadelphia area at that time. 

## Notes

Due to lack of education and the fact that many of the children were descendants of or were former slaves, many of the children’s birthdays and ages are approximated if not entirely unrecorded. Whenever a child’s age or birthday is known to be uncertain, it is recorded in the “Notes” section.
